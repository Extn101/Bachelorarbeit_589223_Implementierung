    "context_text": "SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL. A dead ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.\n"

Once the ball has been placed on the kicking tee, the kicking tee cannot be moved. If\nthe ball falls off the tee, the covering officials must stop play and restart the timing process without penalty to the kicking team.\nIf the ball falls off the tee a second time during the same free kick down, the kicking team then must kick it off the tee with the\nuse of a designated holder during a kickoff or safety kick, or with a holder during an onside kick. The designated holder during\na kickoff or safety kick shall be a uniformed member of the kicking team and may be the 12th person on the field, but he is a\nnon-player, must leave the field on his team’s sideline with the kicking tee immediately after the ball is kicked (5-2-8-h), and\nis also subject to the rules of non-player conduct in accordance with Rule 13.

See\nArticle 6 below for the setup zone for an onside kick.\n(e) The “landing zone” shall be the area from the receiving team’s 20-yard line extending to its goal line.\nARTICLE 3. KICKOFF OR SAFETY KICK FORMATION. From the time the kicker begins his approach to the ball and until the\nball touches the ground or a player in the landing zone or the end zone:\n(a) All kicking team players must be inbounds and:\n(1) all kicking team players other than the kicker must be lined up with their front foot on the kicking team’s restraining line,\nand both feet must remain on the ground;\n(2) at least two players must be lined up inbounds between the sideline and the bottom (outside) of the yard-line number,\nat least two players must be lined up between the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds lines, and at\nleast two players must be lined up inside the inbounds lines.\n(3) the kicker may be beyond the kicker’s restraining line, provided his kicking foot is not beyond the line.\n(4) after the kick, the kicker may not cross the vicinity of the 50-yard line until the ball touches the ground or player in the\nlanding zone or the end zone.\n(b) All receiving team players must be inbounds and on or behind their restraining line, and at least nine players must be\npositioned in the setup zone. The following applies to the receiving team players in the setup zone:\n(1) Players on Restraining Line.

If the receiving team elects to have more than nine players in the setup zone, then at least seven\nplayers must be lined up with their front foot on the receiving team’s restraining line.\na. At least one of the players must be lined up between the inbounds lines.\nb. At least one of the players must be lined up between the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds\nline on each side of the field.\nc. At least one of the players must be lined up between the sideline and the bottom (outside) of the yard-line\nnumber on each side of the field.\n(2) Remaining Players in the Setup Zone (Not on Restraining Line). The receiving team may have a maximum of three\nplayers in the setup zone not on the restraining line, but never more than one player in each of the three areas within\nthe setup zone bordered by the sidelines and inbounds lines.\n(3) At least three players must be lined up outside the inbounds line on each side of the field.\n(4) All receiving team players lined up outside the setup zone must remain behind the receiving team’s 20-yard line until\nthe ball is kicked and behind the receiving team’s 30-yard line until the ball lands or is touched by a receiving team\nplayer in the landing zone or end zone.\n(c) All players of the kicking team other than the kicker, and all receiving team players in the setup zone, must have both feet\nremain on the ground.\n(d) Once the kicking team is lined up in a stationary position, the receiving team shall be permitted a reasonable amount of time\nto line up in the setup zone.\nPenalty: For a player being beyond the restraining line when the ball is kicked (offside), a player being out of bounds\nwhen the ball is kicked, either team being in an illegal formation when the ball is kicked, kicking team players (other than\nthe kicker) or receiving team players in the setup zone moving before permitted, or kicker moving beyond 15 yards from\nthe kicker’s restraining line before permitted (illegal formation): Loss of five yards.\nARTICLE 4. CATCH OR RECOVERY OF A KICKOFF OR SAFETY KICK.

If the catch or recovery is legal, the ball belongs to the kicking\nteam at the dead ball spot.\n(2) it is downed by the receiving team in the end zone or goes out of bounds in the end zone (touchback).\n(3) it first touches the ground or a player in advance of the front yard line of the landing zone.\n(e) If the live ball comes to rest anywhere in the landing zone or in the end zone, and no player attempts to possess it, the ball\nbecomes dead and belongs to the receiving team at the dead ball spot.\nARTICLE 5. KICKOFF OR SAFETY KICK CROSSES GOAL LINE. A kickoff or safety kick into the end zone that remains\ninbounds is a live ball and must be returned or downed by the receiving team. It is a touchback and the dead ball spot is the 20-\nyard line if a kickoff or a safety kick:\n(a) touches the ground or a player in the landing zone and is downed in the end zone by the receiving team or goes out of bounds\nbehind the receiving team’s goal line;\nThe dead ball spot is the 35-yard line if, without first touching the ground or a player in the landing zone, a kickoff or safety kick:\n(b) goes out of bounds behind the receiving team’s goal line;\n(c) strikes the receiving team’s goal post, uprights, or cross bar; or\n(d) lands at or beyond the goal line and is downed in the end zone by the receiving team.\nARTICLE 6. ONSIDE KICK. At any time during the game, the kicking team, if trailing its opponent, may declare an onside kick\nby notifying the Referee prior to the start of the play clock (25-second play clock after the Back Judge hands the kicker the ball).\nThe Referee will then notify the receiving team before starting the play clock and the following rules will apply:\n(a) An onside kick is defined as a free kick that the kicking team attempts to legally recover from the kicking team’s restraining\nline to the furthest point downfield within the onside kick setup zone (See definition of onside kick setup zone in (h) below).\n(b) The restraining line for the kicking team on an onside kick is the kicking team’s 35-yard line or the kicking team’s 20-yard line\nfor a safety kick unless either line is adjusted because of a distance penalty.\n(c) The following applies to kicking team players other than the kicker from the time the kicker begins his approach to the ball and\nuntil the ball is kicked:\n(1) All kicking team players other than the kicker must be lined up with their front foot on the kicking team’s restraining\nline, and both feet must remain on the ground until the ball is kicked; and\n(2) No more than five players of the kicking team may be on either side of the ball with the holder counting as one of the\nfive on either side; and\n(3) On each side of the ball, at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up inbounds between the sideline\nand the bottom (outside) of the yard-line number, and at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up\nbetween the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds lines.\n(d) All kicking team players must be inbounds and behind the ball when it is kicked, except:\n(1) The holder of a place kick may be beyond the line, and\n(2) The kicker may be beyond the line, provided that his kicking foot is not beyond the line.\n(e) A player of the kicking team may legally touch, catch, or recover the ball if:\n(1) It first touches a receiving team player; or\n(2) It reaches or crosses the receiving team’s restraining line.\n(f) The ball is dead if it is caught or recovered by a player of the kicking team. If the catch or recovery is legal, the ball belongs\nto the kicking team at the dead ball spot.\n(g) The restraining line for the receiving team shall be the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team’s restraining line.\n(h) Until the ball is kicked, all receiving team players must be inbounds and behind their restraining line, and at least eight, but\nno more than nine, players must be positioned between their restraining line and a spot 15 yards behind their restraining line\n(the “onside kick setup zone”).\n(i) If a player of the receiving team catches or recovers the ball, he may advance.\n(j) If the ball comes to rest anywhere on the field, and no player attempts to possess it, the ball becomes dead and belongs to\nthe receiving team at the dead ball spot.\n(k) If the onside kick goes untouched beyond the onside kick setup zone, the ball becomes dead and belongs to the receiving\nteam.\nNotes:\n(1) A player is deemed to have not touched the ball if it is batted or illegally kicked into him by an opponent.

A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball.

PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control."

Each team is permitted a minimum of two challenges that will initiate Instant Replay reviews:\n(a) The head coach can initiate a challenge by throwing a red flag onto the field of play before the next legal snap or kick.\n(b) A team that commits a foul that prevents the next snap can no longer challenge the previous play. The non-fouling team can\nstill challenge the previous play, and both teams can benefit from the review.\n(c) The head coach may challenge on-field rulings listed in Section 3, except for those plays that only the Replay Official can\nreview (Article 2).\n(d) Each challenge requires an available team timeout. A team that is out of timeouts, or has used all its available challenges,\nmay not attempt to initiate a challenge.\nA team that initiates a challenge when the team is not permitted to challenge will be charged a team timeout.\nPenalty: For initiating a challenge when a team has exhausted its timeouts: Loss of 15 yards enforced as a foul between\ndowns.\n(e) If a challenge is unsuccessful, the team will be charged a timeout.\n(f) A team will be permitted a third challenge if it is successful on at least one of its challenges. A fourth challenge will not be\npermitted.\nARTICLE 2. REPLAY OFFICIAL REQUEST FOR REVIEW. Only the Replay Official or the Senior Vice President of Officiating or\nhis or her designee may initiate a review of a play:\n(a) that begins after the two-minute warning of each half;\n(b) throughout any overtime period;\n(c) when points are scored by either team;\n(d) that is a Try attempt (successful or unsuccessful); and\n(e) when on-field officials rule:\n(1) an interception by an opponent;\n(2) a fumble or backward pass recovered by an opponent or that goes out of bounds through the opponent’s end zone;\n(3) that the offense failed to reach the line to gain on fourth down;\n(4) possession by the kicking team at the end of any free kick or scrimmage kick down; or\n(5) a disqualification of a player.\nSuch plays may be reviewed regardless of whether a foul is committed on the play that, if accepted, would negate the on-field\nruling.\nThe Replay Official may only initiate a review of a play until the next legal snap or kick. The Replay Official may consult with a\ndesignated member of the Officiating department at the League office regarding whether to initiate a review.\n"
