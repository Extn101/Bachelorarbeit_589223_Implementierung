    "context_text": "RULE 1 THE FIELD SECTION 1 DIMENSIONS\nARTICLE 1. PLAYING LINES. The game shall be played upon a rectangular field, 360 feet in length and 160 feet in width. The\nlines at each end of the field are termed end lines. Those on each side are termed sidelines. Goal lines shall be established in the\nfield 10 yards from and parallel to each end line. The area bounded by goal lines and sidelines is known as the field of play. The\nsurface of the entire field of play must be a League-approved shade of green. The areas bounded by goal lines, end lines, and\nsidelines are known as the end zones.\nThe areas bounded by goal lines and lines parallel to, and 70 feet 9 inches inbounds, from each sideline, are known as the side\nzones. The lines parallel to sidelines are termed inbounds lines. The end lines and the sidelines are also termed boundary lines.\nARTICLE 2. FIELD.\nThe field includes the field of play and the end zones. The field will be rimmed by a solid white border a minimum of 6 feet wide\nalong the end lines and sidelines. An additional broken limit line 6 feet further outside this border is to encompass the field in the\nnon-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench areas (all\nbenches a minimum 30 feet back from the sidelines). In addition, within each bench area, a yellow line 6 feet behind the solid white\nborder will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player charting the game, must remain. If a\nclub’s solid white border is a minimum of 12 feet wide, there is no requirement that the broken restraining line also be added in the\nnon-bench areas. However, the appropriate yellow line described above must be clearly marked within the bench areas.\nIn special circumstances (for example, an artificial surface in a multi-purpose stadium) and subject to prior approval from the League\nOffice, a club may omit the 6-foot solid white border during the preseason or later period while football overlaps with another sport,\nand substitute a single 4-inch white line at what normally would be the outer limit of the solid border (6 feet from the sidelines).\nSECTION 2 MARKINGS\nARTICLE 1. YARD LINE MARKINGS. At intervals of 5 yards, yard line markings parallel to the goal lines shall be marked in the\nfield of play. These lines are to stop 8 inches short of the 6-foot solid border. Yard line markings shall measure 4-inches wide, and\nare to be extended 4 inches beyond the white 6-foot border along the sidelines.\nARTICLE 2. INBOUNDS LINES AND YARD MARKERS.\nItem 1. Inbounds Lines. The inbounds lines are hash marks on the field of play that are 70 feet, 9 inches from and parallel to each\nsideline and intersect each yard line marking at right angles.\nItem 2. Yard Markers. In line with the inbounds lines there shall be hash marks at 1-yard intervals between each distance of 5 yards\nfor the full length of the field. There shall be corresponding hash marks at 1-yard intervals on each side of the field that are to begin\n8 inches from the 6-foot solid border and are to measure 2 feet in length.\nARTICLE 3. GOAL LINE. All measurements are to be made from the inside edges of the line marking the boundary lines. Each\ngoal line marking is to be in its end zone so that the edge of the line toward the field of play (actual goal line) is 30 feet from the\ninside edge of the end line. Each goal line is to be 8 inches wide.\nThe four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked, at inside corners, by weighted pylons. In addition, two such pylons\nshall be placed on each end line (four in all).\nARTICLE 4. ADDITIONAL FIELD MARKINGS AND REQUIREMENTS.\nItem 1. Field Numerals. Bottoms of numbers indicating yard lines in multiples of 10 must be placed beginning 12 yards in from\neach sideline. Each numeral must be in white and measure 2 yards in length.\nItem 2. Other Requirements. Two yards from the middle of each goal line and parallel to it, there shall be marked in the field of\nplay, lines 1 yard in length.\nAll boundary lines, goal lines, and line markings are to be continuous lines. These, and any other specified markings, must be in\nwhite, and there shall be no exceptions without the authorization of the Commissioner.\nCare must be exercised in any end zone marking or decoration or club identification at the 50-yard line that said marking or\ndecorations do not in any way cause confusion as to delineation of goal lines, sidelines, end lines, or other field markings. Such\nmarkings or decorations must be approved by the Commissioner.\nAll lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin. It is desirable that the yard line markers be flexible in\norder to prevent injury. No benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 30 feet from sidelines.\nSECTION 3 GOAL\nARTICLE 1. CROSSBAR. In the plane of each end line, there shall be a centrally placed horizontal crossbar 18 feet, 6 inches in\nlength, the top face of which is 10 feet above the ground. The goal is the vertical plane extending indefinitely above the crossbar\nand between the lines indicated by the outer edges of the goal posts.\nARTICLE 2. GOAL POSTS. All goal posts will be the single-standard type, offset from the end line, bright gold in color, and padded\nin a manner prescribed by the League. The uprights will extend 35 feet above the crossbar and will be no less than 3 inches and no\nmore than 4 inches in diameter. An orange-colored ribbon 4 inches by 42 inches is to be attached to the top of each post.\nSECTION 4 CHAIN CREW AND BALL CREW\nMembers of the chain crew and the ball crew must be uniformly identifiable as specified by the Commissioner. White shirts are to be\nworn by members of the chain crew. It is the responsibility of each team to furnish playable balls at all times by members of the ball\ncrew from either side of the playing field.\nSECTION 5 SIDELINE MARKERS\nThe home club must provide and use the standard set of sideline markers that have been approved by the Commissioner."

    "context_text": "RULE 1 THE FIELD SECTION 1 DIMENSIONS\nARTICLE 1. PLAYING LINES. The game shall be played upon a rectangular field, 360 feet in length and 160 feet in width. The\nlines at each end of the field are termed end lines. Those on each side are termed sidelines. Goal lines shall be established in the\nfield 10 yards from and parallel to each end line. The area bounded by goal lines and sidelines is known as the field of play. The\nsurface of the entire field of play must be a League-approved shade of green. The areas bounded by goal lines, end lines, and\nsidelines are known as the end zones.\nThe areas bounded by goal lines and lines parallel to, and 70 feet 9 inches inbounds, from each sideline, are known as the side\nzones. The lines parallel to sidelines are termed inbounds lines. The end lines and the sidelines are also termed boundary lines.\nARTICLE 2. FIELD.\nThe field includes the field of play and the end zones. The field will be rimmed by a solid white border a minimum of 6 feet wide\nalong the end lines and sidelines. An additional broken limit line 6 feet further outside this border is to encompass the field in the\nnon-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench areas (all\nbenches a minimum 30 feet back from the sidelines). In addition, within each bench area, a yellow line 6 feet behind the solid white\nborder will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player charting the game, must remain. If a\nclub’s solid white border is a minimum of 12 feet wide, there is no requirement that the broken restraining line also be added in the\nnon-bench areas. However, the appropriate yellow line described above must be clearly marked within the bench areas.\nIn special circumstances (for example, an artificial surface in a multi-purpose stadium) and subject to prior approval from the League\nOffice, a club may omit the 6-foot solid white border during the preseason or later period while football overlaps with another sport,\nand substitute a single 4-inch white line at what normally would be the outer limit of the solid border (6 feet from the sidelines).\nSECTION 2 MARKINGS\nARTICLE 1. YARD LINE MARKINGS. At intervals of 5 yards, yard line markings parallel to the goal lines shall be marked in the\nfield of play. These lines are to stop 8 inches short of the 6-foot solid border. Yard line markings shall measure 4-inches wide, and\nare to be extended 4 inches beyond the white 6-foot border along the sidelines.\nARTICLE 2. INBOUNDS LINES AND YARD MARKERS.\nItem 1. Inbounds Lines. The inbounds lines are hash marks on the field of play that are 70 feet, 9 inches from and parallel to each\nsideline and intersect each yard line marking at right angles.\nItem 2. Yard Markers. In line with the inbounds lines there shall be hash marks at 1-yard intervals between each distance of 5 yards\nfor the full length of the field. There shall be corresponding hash marks at 1-yard intervals on each side of the field that are to begin\n8 inches from the 6-foot solid border and are to measure 2 feet in length.\nARTICLE 3. GOAL LINE. All measurements are to be made from the inside edges of the line marking the boundary lines. Each\ngoal line marking is to be in its end zone so that the edge of the line toward the field of play (actual goal line) is 30 feet from the\ninside edge of the end line. Each goal line is to be 8 inches wide.\nThe four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked, at inside corners, by weighted pylons. In addition, two such pylons\nshall be placed on each end line (four in all).\nARTICLE 4. ADDITIONAL FIELD MARKINGS AND REQUIREMENTS.\nItem 1. Field Numerals. Bottoms of numbers indicating yard lines in multiples of 10 must be placed beginning 12 yards in from\neach sideline. Each numeral must be in white and measure 2 yards in length.\nItem 2. Other Requirements. Two yards from the middle of each goal line and parallel to it, there shall be marked in the field of\nplay, lines 1 yard in length.\nAll boundary lines, goal lines, and line markings are to be continuous lines. These, and any other specified markings, must be in\nwhite, and there shall be no exceptions without the authorization of the Commissioner.\nCare must be exercised in any end zone marking or decoration or club identification at the 50-yard line that said marking or\ndecorations do not in any way cause confusion as to delineation of goal lines, sidelines, end lines, or other field markings. Such\nmarkings or decorations must be approved by the Commissioner.\nAll lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin. It is desirable that the yard line markers be flexible in\norder to prevent injury. No benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 30 feet from sidelines.\nSECTION 3 GOAL\nARTICLE 1. CROSSBAR. In the plane of each end line, there shall be a centrally placed horizontal crossbar 18 feet, 6 inches in\nlength, the top face of which is 10 feet above the ground. The goal is the vertical plane extending indefinitely above the crossbar\nand between the lines indicated by the outer edges of the goal posts.\nARTICLE 2. GOAL POSTS. All goal posts will be the single-standard type, offset from the end line, bright gold in color, and padded\nin a manner prescribed by the League. The uprights will extend 35 feet above the crossbar and will be no less than 3 inches and no\nmore than 4 inches in diameter. An orange-colored ribbon 4 inches by 42 inches is to be attached to the top of each post.\nSECTION 4 CHAIN CREW AND BALL CREW\nMembers of the chain crew and the ball crew must be uniformly identifiable as specified by the Commissioner. White shirts are to be\nworn by members of the chain crew. It is the responsibility of each team to furnish playable balls at all times by members of the ball\ncrew from either side of the playing field.\nSECTION 5 SIDELINE MARKERS\nThe home club must provide and use the standard set of sideline markers that have been approved by the Commissioner."

    "context_text": "SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL. A dead ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.\n"

The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.\n"

The Referee shall suspend play while the ball is dead and declare a charged team\ntimeout upon the request for a timeout by the head coach or any player (not a substitute) to any official. If an assistant coach\nsignals for a timeout and it is inadvertently granted, the timeout will stand.\nItem 1. Three Timeouts Allowed. A team is allowed three charged team timeouts during each half. The Referee or another\ngame official will notify the head coach when he has exhausted his three charged team timeouts in a half.\nItem 2. Length of Timeouts. Charged team timeouts shall be two minutes in length unless the timeout is not used by television\nfor a commercial break. Timeouts shall be 30 seconds in length when the designated number of television commercials have\nbeen exhausted in a quarter, if it is a second charged team timeout in the same dead ball period, or when the Referee so\nindicates.\nItem 3. Consecutive Team Timeouts. Each team may be granted a charged team timeout during the same dead ball period,\nbut a second charged team timeout by either team during the same dead ball period is prohibited. Such team timeouts may\nfollow a Referee’s timeout or any automatic timeouts.\nPenalty: For when a team requests a second timeout during the same dead ball period, or a timeout after exhausting its\nthree timeouts during a half: Loss of five yards for delay of game and the timeout is charged.\nIf the timeout is by the offense while time is in after the two-minute warning, a 10-second runoff option is available. If\nthe timeout is by the defense while time is in, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds. If time is in, the game clock will\nstart with the ready for play signal unless the offense chooses to have the clock start on the snap.\nItem 4. Unsportsmanlike Conduct. An attempt to call an excess team timeout, or to call a second timeout in the same dead\nball period, by Team B in an attempt to “freeze” a kicker, shall be ignored and is unsportsmanlike conduct even if inadvertently\ngranted (See 12-3-1-v). The timeout will be charged if inadvertently granted. This will apply to field goal or Try attempts.\nARTICLE 2. INJURY TIMEOUTS. If an official determines a player to be injured, or if attendants from the bench come on the\nfield to assist an injured player, an injury timeout will be called by the Referee. If the AT Spotter identifies a player for medical\nattention, the rules pertaining to Injury Timeouts in Article 3 and Article 4 (c) apply.\nARTICLE 3. INJURY TIMEOUTS PRIOR TO TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. When an injury timeout is called,\nthe injured player must leave the game for the completion of one down. The player will be permitted to remain in the game if:\n(a) either team calls a charged team timeout;\n(b) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(c) the period ends or the two-minute warning occurs before the next snap.\nAt the conclusion of an injury timeout, the game clock will start as if the injury timeout had not occurred. If either team takes or is\ncharged with a timeout, the clock will start on the snap.\nARTICLE 4. INJURY TIMEOUTS AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. After the two-minute warning of a half,\nthe following shall apply:\n(a) If a team has not used its three charged team timeouts, the team of the injured player will be charged a team timeout,\nunless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field\ngoal, or an attempted Try.\n(b) If a team has used its three charged team timeouts, an excess team timeout shall be called by the Referee, unless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field\ngoal, or an attempted Try.\n(c) The player must leave the game for the completion of one down, unless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) either team calls or is charged a team timeout other than an excess timeout.\nPenalty: For the second and each subsequent excess team timeout after the two-minute warning: Loss of five yards\nfrom the succeeding spot for delay of the game.\nNotes:\n(1) No yardage penalty will be assessed for the first excess team timeout, but a 10-second runoff of the game clock may\nbe applicable pursuant to Note 3 below. At the conclusion of an excess timeout taken while time is in, the game clock\nshall start with the ready for play signal, unless the opponent chooses to have the clock start on the snap. For any\nexcess timeout charged to the defense, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds.\n(2) If the Referee has already called an excess team timeout in that half for a team, any subsequent excess timeout for that\nteam will result in a five-yard penalty, and a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to Note 3\nbelow. (A penalty for a fifth and subsequent excess timeout for injury shall be considered a foul between downs and will\nnot offset a foul or be part of a multiple foul. See 14-1-2-Item 4-Exc.).\n(3) If an excess team timeout is charged against a team in possession of the ball, and the timeout causes the clock to stop\nor delays the clock from starting on the ready for play signal, the ball shall not be put in play until the time on the game\nclock has been reduced by 10 seconds, if the defense so chooses, the play clock reset to 30 seconds, and the game\nclock shall start with the ready for play.\n(4) Either half can end as the result of the 10-second runoff referenced above.\n(5) If an injury timeout is called for both teams during or after a down, charged team timeouts and/or excess team timeouts\nare charged as appropriate, but no yardage or 10-second runoff penalties shall be enforced.\n(6) If a foul by either team occurs during a down in which there is also an injury, such foul does not affect the charging of\nan excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff that may result from the excess timeout, because the foul\nstopped the clock.\n(7) If a dead ball foul by either team occurs after a play in which there is also an injury to the opposing team, such foul\ndoes not affect the charging of an excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff or 40-second play clock reset\nthat may result from the excess timeout.\n(8) The Competition Committee deprecates feigning injuries, with subsequent withdrawal, to obtain a timeout without\npenalty. Coaches are urged to cooperate in discouraging this practice.\n(9) There can never be a 10-second runoff against the defensive team.\nARTICLE 5. REFEREE’S TIMEOUT. Provided that calling timeout is not in conflict with another rule, the Referee may suspend\nplay and stop the clock (Referee’s timeout) at any time without penalty to either team when playing time is being consumed\nbecause of an unintentional delay. Such situations include, but are not limited to:\n(a) when there is the possibility of a measurement for a first down, or if the Referee is consulting with a captain about one;\n(b) when there is an undue pileup on the runner, or while determining possession after a fumble while time is in;\n(c) when there is an undue delay by officials in spotting the ball for the next snap;\n(d) if the snap is made before the officials can assume their positions (See 4-6-5-b if it is a repeated act);\n(e) when there is an injury to an official or member of the chain crew;\n(f) during an officials’ conference; or\n(g) while repairing or replacing game equipment, except player equipment.\nAfter a Referee’s timeout, the time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it was stopped. The play clock and\nthe game clock will start as if the Referee’s timeout had not occurred."

SPEAKERS IN HELMETS. The Coach-to-Player system allows a member of the coaching staff in the bench area\nor the coaches’ booth to communicate to a designated offensive or defensive player with a speaker in his helmet. The\ncommunication begins once a game official has signaled a down to be over and is cut off when the play clock reaches 15 seconds\nor the ball is snapped, whichever occurs first.\nEach offensive and defensive team is permitted no more than one player on the field with a speaker in his helmet. Each team is\npermitted to have a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on offense by its quarterbacks, and a maximum of three\nactive radio receivers to be used on defense by players who have been designated as primary and backup users.\nClubs that have a player whose principal position is as a non-quarterback (e.g., wide receiver, running back) and who also is used\nas a quarterback from time to time must have two helmets for that player—one with and one without radio components.\nWhen a quarterback enters the game for the first time or re-enters the game if he has previously been in the game and removed,\nhe must report to the Referee.\nWhenever the backup defensive user enters or re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire.\nIf the primary defensive user subsequently re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire. If\nthe primary and backup players have been removed from the game, no other player may wear the radio speaker in his helmet.\nTeams must use other methods to communicate signals to their players.\nIt is not necessary that the offensive player with the speaker in his helmet receive the snap.\nFor special teams’ plays, only one player per team with a receiver will be permitted on the field.\nAll players that have radio components in their helmet must have a decal, supplied by the League, displayed on the midline of the\nrear of the helmet. Players who have speakers in their helmets must be identified in the Communication System section of the\nGame Day Administration Report that is submitted to the Referee or a member of his crew no later than one hour and 30 minutes\nprior to kickoff.\nFor additional requirements and policies pertaining to the system, including regulations for the storage of a backup helmet for a\nnon-quarterback who is used as a quarterback, or for the backup defensive player’s helmet, please refer to the Policy Manual for\nMember Clubs/Game Operations.\nPenalty: For a player failing to notify the Referee or Umpire of a change in his status when required: Loss of five yards\nfor illegal substitution."

    "context_text": "SECTION 7 BACKWARD PASS AND FUMBLE\nARTICLE 1. BACKWARD PASS. A runner may throw a backward pass at any time (3-21-4). Players of either team may advance\nafter catching a backward pass, or recovering a backward pass after it touches the ground. Any snap from center is a backward\npass.\nARTICLE 2. BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS. If a backward pass goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the ball is\ndead (7-6-2-a), and it is next put in play at the inbounds spot. Rule 11 governs if a backward pass is declared dead behind the\ngoal line. During a play that starts after the two-minute warning of either half, if a backward pass goes out of bounds before a\nchange of possession, it is an action that conserves time (4-7-1).\nPenalty: For a backward pass out of bounds before a change of possession during a play that starts after the two-minute\nwarning. Loss of down and 5 yards.\nARTICLE 3. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than a pass or kick, which results in a loss of player possession.\nException: If a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass (3-2-5-Note).\nItem 1. Recovery and Advance. Any player of either team may recover or catch a fumble and advance, either before or after the\nball strikes the ground, unless the fumble occurs on fourth down (See 8-7-5 below), after the two-minute warning, or during a Try\n(See 8-7-6 below).\nItem 2. Legal Recovery. For a legal recovery of a fumble, see 3-2-7.\nItem 3. Out of Bounds in the Field of Play. When a fumble goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a fumble goes backward and out of bounds, the ball is next put in play at the inbounds spot by the team that was last in\npossession;\n(b) If a fumble goes forward and out of bounds, the ball is next put in play at the spot of the fumble by the team that was last in\npossession;\n(c) If a ball is fumbled in a team’s own end zone and goes forward into the field of play and out of bounds, it will result in a safety,\nif that team provided the impetus that put the ball into the end zone (See 11-5-1 for exception for momentum). If the impetus\nwas provided by the opponent, the play will result in a touchback; or\n(d) Notwithstanding any of the above, when there has not been a change of possession during the down, and the spot of the ball\nis not at or beyond the line to gain after fourth down, the ball is awarded to Team B at the spot that the ball is declared dead.\nItem 4. Out of Bounds in End Zone. When a fumble goes out of bounds in the end zone, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a ball is fumbled in the field of play, and goes forward into the opponent’s end zone and over the end line or sideline, a\ntouchback is awarded to the defensive team; or\n(b) If a ball is fumbled in a team’s own end zone or in the field of play and goes out of bounds in the end zone, it is a safety, if\nthat team provided the impetus that sent the ball into the end zone (See 11-5-1 for exception for momentum). If the impetus\nwas provided by the opponent, it is a touchback.\nARTICLE 4. HANDING BALL FORWARD. No player may hand the ball forward except to an eligible receiver who is behind the\nline of scrimmage.\n(a) Loss of player possession by unsuccessful execution of attempted handing is a fumble charged to the player that last had\npossession.\n(b) A muffed handoff (legal or illegal) is a fumble, and the ball remains alive.\nPenalties:\n(a) For handing ball forward beyond the line of scrimmage: Loss of down and five yards from spot of the foul.\n(b) For handing ball forward to an ineligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage: Loss of down and five yards\nfrom the previous spot.\n(c) For handing ball forward after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from the spot of the foul.\nARTICLE 5. FOURTH DOWN FUMBLE. If a fourth down fumble occurs during a play from scrimmage:\n(a) The ball may be advanced by any member of the defensive team.\n(b) The player who fumbled is the only Team A player permitted to recover and advance the ball prior to a change of possession.\n(c) If, prior to a change of a possession, the recovery or catch is by a teammate of the player who fumbled, the ball is dead, and\nthe spot of the next snap is the spot of the fumble, or the spot of the recovery if the spot of the recovery is behind the spot of\nthe fumble.\nARTICLE 6. FUMBLE AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OR DURING A TRY. If a fumble by either team occurs after the twominute\nwarning or during a Try:\n(a) The ball may be advanced by any opponent.\n(b) The player who fumbled is the only player of his team who is permitted to recover and advance the ball.\n(c) If the recovery or catch is by a teammate of the player who fumbled, the ball is dead, and the spot of the next snap is the spot\nof the fumble, or the spot of the recovery if the spot of the recovery is behind the spot of the fumble.\nARTICLE 7. ENFORCEMENT SPOT DURING A BACKWARD PASS OR FUMBLE. If there is a foul by either team during a\nbackward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or fumble. The three-and-one method of enforcement\nis used (see Rule 14, Section 3, Article 6).\n(a) When the spot of the backward pass or fumble is beyond the line of scrimmage, or when there is not a line of scrimmage,\nand there is a foul during the backward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or the spot of the\nfumble. The three-and-one method of enforcement is used. See 14-3-6.\n(b) When the spot of a backward pass or fumble is behind the line of scrimmage, all fouls committed by either team, including a\nfoul by Team B in Team A’s end zone, are enforced from the previous spot, except a foul by the offense in its end zone is a\nsafety if the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot.\n(c) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered\nby the defense, enforcement is from the dead ball spot. If the recovering team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is\nenforced from the spot of its recovery, and it retains possession. This also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike\nconduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the offense, and the offense fails to make\nthe line to gain.\nNotes:\n(1) If Team B gains possession in its end zone, and the impetus was by Team A, if Team B fumbles or throws a\nbackward pass in the end zone, and fouls while the ball is loose, the spot of the fumble or the backward pass is\nconsidered to be the B20-yard line, or the B35-yard line or B20-yard line (as applicable) if the impetus was from a\nfree kick.\n(2) If a Team B player’s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where he fumbles the ball, the spot of the fumble\nis considered to be the spot at which the player established possession. See 11-5-1-Exc. 2. SECTION 1 FORWARD PASS\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITION. It is a forward pass if:\n(a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent’s goal line) after leaving the passer’s hand(s);\n(b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the\npoint at which the ball leaves the passer’s hand(s); or\n(c) a ball is intentionally fumbled and goes forward.\nItem 1. Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional\nforward movement of his hand starts a forward pass.\n(a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he\npasses the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs,\nintentional grounding rules do not apply.\n(b) When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the\ndirection of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply.\n(c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it\nback toward his body, it is a fumble.\n(d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.\nARTICLE 2. LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down.\nIf the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of\nwhether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.\nItem 1. Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including:\n(a) a forward pass thrown when the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released,\nwhether the passer is airborne or touching the ground.\n(b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage.\n(c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it.\n(d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.\nItem 2. Intercepted Illegal Pass. If an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced, and the penalty declined.\nPenalties:\n(a) For a forward pass from beyond the line: Loss of down and five yards from the spot where the ball is released.\n(b) For a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind\nthe line: Loss of down and five yards from the previous spot.\n(c) For a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from where the ball is released.\nNotes:\n(1) Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line,\nregardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do\nnot apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a free kick play, (c) on a fair catch kick play, or (d)\nafter a change of possession.\n(2) Roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-11). If a\npass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer.\nARTICLE 3. COMPLETED OR INTERCEPTED PASS. A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. A forward pass is\ncomplete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is\ninbounds:\n(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and\n(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and\n(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly performs any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward, take an\nadditional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long\nenough to do so.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an\nincomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds.\n(3) A receiver is considered a player in a defenseless posture (See Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9) throughout the entire\nprocess of the catch and until the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent.\n(4) If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers.\nIt is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. If the ball is\nmuffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the\nloose ball.\n(5) If a player, who is in control of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part\nof his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass. It is not necessary\nfor the player to maintain control of the ball when he lands out of bounds.\n(6) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel) then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nARTICLE 4. INCOMPLETE PASS. An incomplete pass is a loss of down, and the ball returns to the previous spot. Any forward\npass (legal or illegal) is incomplete and the ball is dead immediately if:\n(a) The process of the catch in 8-1-3 is not completed;\n(b) The ball goes out of bounds; or\n(c) A player is the first to touch a pass after having been out of bounds, but prior to reestablishing himself inbounds with both feet\nor any body part other than his hands. There is not a foul for illegal touching.\nARTICLE 5. ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. The following players are eligible to catch a forward pass that is thrown from behind the\nline of scrimmage:\n(a) Defensive players;\n(b) Offensive players who are on either end of the line, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (0–49 and 80–\n89) or have legally reported to play a position on the end of the line. See 5-1-2;\n(c) Offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of\neligible players (0–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield;\n(d) All offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player; or\n(e) An eligible receiver who is forced out of bounds by an opponent’s foul, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately\nand reestablishes inbounds with both feet or with any body part other than his hands, without prior touching.\nARTICLE 6. INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. All offensive players other than those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch\na legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including:\n(a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped;\n(b) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible as required by Article 5;\n(c) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, either by his own volition or by being legally forced\nout, even if he has reestablished himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; or\n(d) A player who takes his stance as a T-Formation Quarterback unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position\nat least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line and is stationary in that position for at least one second\nbefore the snap.\nARTICLE 7. LEGAL TOUCHING. A forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible\nplayer. A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass\nin the end zone.\nARTICLE 8. ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A FORWARD PASS. It is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal)\nthrown from behind the line of scrimmage:\n(a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball; or\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass: Loss of five yards at the previous spot.\n(b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being\nlegally forced out of bounds and has reestablished himself inbounds. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball.\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass after being out of bounds: Loss of down at the previous spot.\n"

It is a forward pass if:\n(a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent’s goal line) after leaving the passer’s hand(s);\n(b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the\npoint at which the ball leaves the passer’s hand(s); or\n(c) a ball is intentionally fumbled and goes forward.\nItem 1. Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional\nforward movement of his hand starts a forward pass.\n(a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he\npasses the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs,\nintentional grounding rules do not apply.\n(b) When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the\ndirection of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply.\n(c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it\nback toward his body, it is a fumble.\n(d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.\nARTICLE 2. LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down.\nIf the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of\nwhether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.\nItem 1. Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including:\n(a) a forward pass thrown when the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released,\nwhether the passer is airborne or touching the ground.\n(b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage.\n(c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it.\n(d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.\nItem 2.

If the ball is\nmuffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the\nloose ball.\n(5) If a player, who is in control of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part\nof his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass.

If an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced, and the penalty declined.\nPenalties:\n(a) For a forward pass from beyond the line: Loss of down and five yards from the spot where the ball is released.\n(b) For a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind\nthe line: Loss of down and five yards from the previous spot.\n(c) For a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from where the ball is released.\nNotes:\n(1) Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line,\nregardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do\nnot apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a free kick play, (c) on a fair catch kick play, or (d)\nafter a change of possession.\n(2) Roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-11). If a\npass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer.\nARTICLE 3. COMPLETED OR INTERCEPTED PASS. A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. A forward pass is\ncomplete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is\ninbounds:\n(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and\n(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and\n(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly performs any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward, take an\nadditional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long\nenough to do so.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an\nincomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds.\n(3) A receiver is considered a player in a defenseless posture (See Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9) throughout the entire\nprocess of the catch and until the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent.\n(4) If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers.\nIt is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. If the ball is\nmuffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the\nloose ball.\n(5) If a player, who is in control of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part\nof his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass. It is not necessary\nfor the player to maintain control of the ball when he lands out of bounds.\n(6) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel) then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nARTICLE 4. INCOMPLETE PASS. An incomplete pass is a loss of down, and the ball returns to the previous spot. Any forward\npass (legal or illegal) is incomplete and the ball is dead immediately if:\n(a) The process of the catch in 8-1-3 is not completed;\n(b) The ball goes out of bounds; or\n(c) A player is the first to touch a pass after having been out of bounds, but prior to reestablishing himself inbounds with both feet\nor any body part other than his hands. There is not a foul for illegal touching.\nARTICLE 5. ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. The following players are eligible to catch a forward pass that is thrown from behind the\nline of scrimmage:\n(a) Defensive players;\n(b) Offensive players who are on either end of the line, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (0–49 and 80–\n89) or have legally reported to play a position on the end of the line. See 5-1-2;\n(c) Offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of\neligible players (0–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield;\n(d) All offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player; or\n(e) An eligible receiver who is forced out of bounds by an opponent’s foul, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately\nand reestablishes inbounds with both feet or with any body part other than his hands, without prior touching.\nARTICLE 6. INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. All offensive players other than those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch\na legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including:\n(a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped;\n(b) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible as required by Article 5;\n(c) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, either by his own volition or by being legally forced\nout, even if he has reestablished himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; or\n(d) A player who takes his stance as a T-Formation Quarterback unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position\nat least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line and is stationary in that position for at least one second\nbefore the snap.\nARTICLE 7. LEGAL TOUCHING. A forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible\nplayer. A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass\nin the end zone.\nARTICLE 8. ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A FORWARD PASS. It is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal)\nthrown from behind the line of scrimmage:\n(a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball; or\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass: Loss of five yards at the previous spot.\n(b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being\nlegally forced out of bounds and has reestablished himself inbounds. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball.\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass after being out of bounds: Loss of down at the previous spot.\n"

    "context_text": "SECTION 5 PASS INTERFERENCE\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITION. It is pass interference by either team when any act by a player more than one yard beyond the line of\nscrimmage significantly hinders an eligible player’s opportunity to catch the ball. Pass interference can only occur when a forward\npass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, regardless of whether the pass is legal or illegal, or whether it crosses the line.\nWhen the ball is in the air, eligible offensive and defensive receivers have the same right to the path of the ball and are subject to\nthe same restrictions.\nActs that do not occur more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage are not pass interference but could be offensive or\ndefensive holding (see 12-1-3 and 12-1-6).\nDefensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is thrown until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts\nwhile the ball is in the air.\nOffensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is snapped until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts\nwhile the ball is in the air and Article 4 for prohibited acts prior to the pass.\nARTICLE 2. PROHIBITED ACTS BY BOTH TEAMS WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. Acts that are pass interference include,\nbut are not limited to:\n(a) Contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent’s opportunity to make the catch;\n(b) Playing through the back of an opponent in an attempt to make a play on the ball;\n(c) Grabbing an opponent’s arm(s) in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass;\n(d) Extending an arm across the body of an opponent, thus restricting his ability to catch a pass, and regardless of whether the\nplayer committing such act is playing the ball;\n(e) Cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball;\n(f) Hooking an opponent in an attempt to get to the ball in such a manner that it causes the opponent’s body to turn prior to the\nball arriving; or\n(g) Initiating contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation.\nARTICLE 3. PERMISSIBLE ACTS BY BOTH TEAMS WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. Acts that are permissible by a player\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n(a) Incidental contact by an opponent’s hands, arms, or body when both players are competing for the ball, or neither player is\nlooking for the ball. If there is any question whether contact is incidental, the ruling shall be no interference;\n(b) Inadvertent tangling of feet when both players are playing the ball or neither player is playing the ball;\n(c) Contact that would normally be considered pass interference, but the pass is clearly uncatchable by the involved players,\nexcept as specified in 8-3-2 and 8-5-4 pertaining to blocking downfield by the offense;\n(d) Laying a hand on an opponent that does not restrict him in an attempt to make a play on the ball;\n(e) Contact by a player who has gained position on an opponent in an attempt to catch the ball; or\n(f) When a team presents a punt formation (3-17-7) and before the ball is kicked, acts that normally constitute pass interference\nagainst the end man on the line of scrimmage or against an eligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage, who is aligned or\nin motion more than one yard outside the end man on the line. Defensive holding and offensive pass interference rules still\napply.\nARTICLE 4. OTHER PROHIBITED ACTS BY THE OFFENSE. Acts that are pass interference include:\n(a) Blocking more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage by an offensive player prior to a pass being thrown. See 8-3-1-\nNote for exception for an ineligible offensive player; or\n(b) Blocking a defender beyond the line while the pass is in the air if the block occurs in the vicinity of the player to whom the\npass is thrown. See 8-3-1-Note for exception for ineligible players.\nPenalty: For pass interference by the defense: First down for the offensive team at the spot of the foul. If the interference\nis also a personal foul (12-2), the penalty for such a foul is also enforced, either from the spot of the foul (for interference),\nor from the end of the run if the foul for pass interference is declined. If the spot of the interference is behind the defensive\nteam’s goal line and the previous spot was on or outside the defense’s two-yard line, then, it is first down for the offensive\nteam on the defense’s one-yard line at the inbounds spot corresponding to the spot of the interference, or, if the previous\nspot was inside the defense’s two-yard line, the penalty shall be halfway between the previous spot and the goal line,\nand it is first down for the offensive team.\nPenalty: For pass interference by the offense: Loss of 10 yards from the previous spot."

Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional\nforward movement of his hand starts a forward pass.\n(a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he\npasses the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs,\nintentional grounding rules do not apply.\n(b) When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the\ndirection of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply.\n(c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it\nback toward his body, it is a fumble.\n(d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.\nARTICLE 2. LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down.\nIf the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of\nwhether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.\nItem 1.

A field goal is scored when all of the following conditions are met:\n(a) The kick must be a place kick or drop kick made by the offense from on or behind the line of scrimmage or from the spot of a\nfair catch (fair catch kick). If a fair catch is made or awarded outside the inbounds line, the spot of the kick is the nearest\ninbounds line.\n(b) After the ball is kicked, it must not touch the ground or any player of the offensive team before it passes through the goal.\n(c) The entire ball must pass through the vertical plane of the goal, which is the area above the crossbar and between the uprights\nor, if above the uprights, between their outside edges. If the ball passes through the goal, and returns through the goal without\nstriking the ground or some object or person beyond the goal, the attempt is unsuccessful.\nARTICLE 2. MISSED FIELD GOALS.

If there is a missed field goal attempt that crosses the line of scrimmage, and the ball has\nnot been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, or in the end zone before the ball has touched\nthe ground in the end zone, the following shall apply:\n(a) If the spot of the kick was inside the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the 20-yard line; or\n(b) If the spot of the kick was from the receivers’ 20-yard line or beyond the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the\nspot of the kick.\nExceptions:\nThe special rules pertaining to field goals in (a) and (b) are not applicable, and all general rules for a scrimmage kick will apply\nwhen there is a missed field goal and:\n(1) the ball is touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone before the ball\nhas become dead; or\n(2) the scrimmage kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the\nline of scrimmage.\nNote: If a foul occurs during an unsuccessful field goal attempt in (1) or (2) above, Rule 14-4-8 governs.\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTES:\n(1) If the receivers do not touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, the ball is dead\nas soon as it touches the ground in the end zone, and it is the receivers’ ball at the spot of the kick, or at the 20-yard line\nif the attempt was from inside the 20-yard line.\n(2) If the ball goes out of bounds after it is first touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, it\nis the receivers’ ball at the out of bounds spot.\n(3) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, and the kickers\nrecover, the ball belongs to the kickers at the spot of recovery. If the recovery is in the end zone, it is a touchdown.\n(4) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, and without any new impetus, the ball\nrolls into the end zone where it is declared dead in the possession of the receivers, it is a touchback.\n(5) For a successful field goal, or for an unsuccessful attempt that does not land in the field of play, the maximum amount of\ntime that can run off the game clock is five seconds.\nARTICLE 3. FAIR CATCH KICK. The rules for a field goal attempt from scrimmage apply to a field goal attempt following a fair\ncatch (a fair catch kick).\nExceptions:\n(1) The fair catch kick line for the kicking team is the yard line through the most forward point from which the ball is kicked.\n(2) The fair catch kick line for the receiving team is the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team’s fair catch kick\nline.\n(3) Though this is not a free kick, the rules for onside free kick formation apply (6-1-6).\nNote: The kicking team cannot possess the ball unless it has first been touched by the receivers.\nARTICLE 4. NO TEE. An artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to assist in the execution of a field goal or Try kick\nattempt.\nARTICLE 5. FOREIGN ARTICLES. No article of any type may be placed on the field, or used in any manner, to assist a player\nin the execution of a field goal or Try kick attempt. Nothing other than a hand or finger may be used to mark the spot or the vicinity\nof a kick or hold.\nARTICLE 6. BALL NEXT IN PLAY. After a field goal, the team scored upon will receive the succeeding free kick (6-1-1-a).\n"

It is a safety:\n(a) when the offense commits a foul behind its own goal line and the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot (see also\n14-2-2-b); or\n(b) when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line, and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession, or\nthe ball is out of bounds behind the goal line.\nExceptions:\nIt is not a safety:\n(1) If a forward pass from behind the line of scrimmage is incomplete in the end zone.\n(2) If a defensive player, in the field of play, intercepts a pass or catches or recovers a fumble, backward pass, scrimmage\nkick, free kick, or fair catch kick, and his original momentum carries him into his end zone where the ball is declared dead\nin his team’s possession. The ball belongs to the defensive team at the spot where the player’s foot or other body part\ntouched the ground to establish possession. If that spot is in the end zone, the result of the play is a touchback, even if\nthe ball is not on, above, or beyond the goal line (11-6-1).\n(a) If a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a live ball foul in the end zone, it is a\nsafety.\n(b) If a player who intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball throws a completed or intercepted illegal forward pass from\nthe end zone, the ball remains alive. If his opponent intercepts the illegal pass and scores, it is a touchdown.\n(c) If a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a foul in the field of play, and the ball\nbecomes dead in the end zone, the basic spot is the spot of the change of possession.\n(d) If the spot where possession changed is inside the one-yard line, the ball is to be spotted at the one-yard line.\nNotes:\n(1) A ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of\nplay (3-11-4).\n(2) The impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its\nown goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting or kicking any loose ball (3-16).\nARTICLE 2. BALL IN PLAY AFTER SAFETY. After a safety, the team scored upon must put the ball in play by a free kick (punt,\ndrop kick, or place kick) from its 20-yard line, unless an extension exception applies (4-8-2-g). An artificial or manufactured tee\nmay be used. See 6-1-1-b and 6-1-3."

    "source_ref": "Rule 12, Section 2",
    "context_text": "SECTION 2 PERSONAL FOULS\nARTICLE 1. CLIPPING. Clipping is blocking an opponent from behind below the waist, and is prohibited against a non-runner.\nThis does not apply to offensive blocking in close-line play where it is legal to clip above the knee(s), but it is illegal to clip at or\nbelow the knee(s). See 3-6, close-line play.\nException: An offensive lineman may not clip a defender above the knees who, at the snap, is aligned on the line of\nscrimmage opposite another offensive lineman who is more than one position away, and the defender is responding to the\nflow of the ball away from the blocker. Example: An offensive tackle cannot clip a defensive nose tackle on a sweep away.\nIf there is a block from the side, or if an opponent turns his back as the block is being made, it is not clipping if the opponent\nis able to see or ward off the block.\nIf an offensive player’s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back or side of the leg(s) of a defender, it\nis clipping, including in close-line play.\nWhen a blocker, who is moving in the same direction as an opponent, initially contacts the opponent on his side, and subsequently\ncontacts the opponent below his waist from behind, it is not clipping if the contact is continuous.\nPenalty: For clipping: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 2. PEEL BACK BLOCK. An offensive player cannot initiate contact on the side and below the waist against an opponent\nif:\n(a) the blocker is moving toward his own end line; and\n(b) he approaches the opponent from behind or from the side unless his near shoulder completely crosses the front of both of\nhis opponent’s legs.\nPenalty: For a peel back block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 3. ILLEGAL CUT BLOCK. See 8-4-5.\nARTICLE 4. BLOCKING BELOW THE WAIST. Blocks below the waist are prohibited in the following situations:\n(a) By players of either team after a change of possession; or\n(b) By players of the kicking team after a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt, or Try kick; or\n(c) By players of the receiving team during a down in which there is a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt,\nor Try kick; or\n(d) By players of either team during a scrimmage down prior to a change of possession unless the contact occurs in the tight end\nbox. (Note: Players are prohibited from initiating contact below the waist of an opponent outside the tight end box (See 3-33),\nexcept against a runner or a player who is attempting to catch a forward or backward pass).\nNote: The following blocking restrictions may result in a foul even if they occur in the tight end box:\n(i) Illegal cut block. See 8-4-5.\n(ii) Clipping. See 12-2-1.\n(iii) Peel back block. See 12-2-2.\n(iv) Chop block. See 12-2-5.\n(v) Crackback block. See 12-2-6.\nPenalty: For illegally blocking below the waist: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 5. CHOP BLOCK. All chop blocks are illegal. A chop block is a high/low double team block by the offense in which\none offensive player (designated as A1 for purposes of this rule) blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower while\nanother offensive player (A2) engages that same defensive player above the waist. The order of the blocks is irrelevant. It is not\na foul if the defender initiates the contact with the blocker, or if the blocker is trying to slip or escape from the defender and any\nengagement with him is incidental.\nChop blocks include, but are not limited to, the following situations:\n(a) A1 chops a defensive player while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of\nA2.\n(b) A2 physically engages a defensive player above the waist with a blocking attempt, and A1 chops the defensive player\nafter the contact by A2 has been broken and while A2 is still confronting the defensive player.\n(c) A1 chops a defensive player while A2 confronts the defensive player in a pass-blocking posture but is not physically\nengaged with the defensive player (“lure”).\n(d) A1 blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower, and A2, simultaneously or immediately after the block by\nA1, engages the defensive player high (“reverse chop”).\n(e) A1 is lined up in the backfield at the snap and subsequently chops a defensive player engaged above the waist by A2.\n(f) A1, an offensive lineman, chops a defensive player after the defensive player has been engaged by A2 (high or low).\nPenalty: For chop block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 6. CRACKBACK BLOCK.\nItem 1. Definition. It is an illegal crackback block if the following conditions are fulfilled:\nThe block occurs within an area five yards on either side of the line of scrimmage, including within close-line play, by an offensive\nplayer who is moving toward the position from which the ball was snapped; and\n(a) the offensive player was in a set position and aligned more than two yards outside an offensive tackle (flexed) when the ball\nwas snapped; or\n(b) the offensive player was in a backfield position when the ball was snapped and moved to a position more than two yards\noutside an offensive tackle; or\n(c) the offensive player was in a backfield position and in motion when the ball was snapped.\nItem 2. Prohibited Contact. The following is prohibited against a player who is the recipient of a crackback block:\n(a) Contacting the player below the waist; or\n(b) Initiating contact that is prohibited against a player in a defenseless posture (Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9(b)(1-3)).\nPenalty: For an illegal crackback block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 7. BLINDSIDE BLOCK. It is a foul if a player initiates a block when his path is toward or parallel to his own end line\nand makes forcible contact to his opponent with his helmet, forearm, or shoulder, unless the contact occurs in close-line play prior\nto the ball leaving that area. The ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from shotgun\nposition or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs\nwith the ball himself during a designed play. Any forcible contact in close-line play is still subject to the restrictions for crackback\nand peel back blocks.\nPenalty: For a blindside block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 8. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. There shall be no unnecessary roughness. This shall include, but will not be limited\nto:\n(a) using the foot or any part of the leg to strike an opponent with a whipping motion (leg whip);\n(b) forcibly contacting a runner when he is out of bounds;\nNote: Defensive players must make an effort to avoid contact. Players on defense are responsible for knowing when a runner\nhas crossed the boundary line, except in doubtful cases where he might step on a boundary line and continue parallel with it.\n(c) a player of the receiving team who has gone out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player out of bounds during the kick. If\nthis occurs on a kick from scrimmage, post-possession rules will apply if appropriate (9-5-1);\n(d) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a runner whose forward progress has been stopped, who has slid or\ntaken a knee, or who has declared himself down by going to the ground untouched and has made no attempt to advance.\nSee 7-2-1-d-Notes regarding a sliding player;\n(e) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on any player on the ground either before or after the ball is dead;\n(f) throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;\n(g) unnecessarily running into, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a player who (1) is out of the play or (2) should not\nhave reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead;\n(h) pulling an opponent off a pile of players in an aggressive or forcible manner; or\n(i) a kicker/punter, who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has been kicked, is out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by the receiving team through the end of the down or until he assumes a distinctly defensive position.\nHowever, a kicker/punter is a defenseless player through the conclusion of the down (see 12-2-9-a-8).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the\nofficial(s) to be flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 9. PLAYERS IN A DEFENSELESS POSTURE. It is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player\nwho is in a defenseless posture. A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an\nillegal act. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against an opponent, even if his body position is in motion, and\nirrespective of any acts by him, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.\n(a) Players in a defenseless posture are:\n(1) A player in the act of or just after throwing a pass (passing posture).\n(2) A receiver running a pass route when the defender approaches from the side or behind. If the receiver becomes a blocker\nor assumes a blocking posture, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(3) A player attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player is capable of avoiding\nor warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(4) The intended receiver of a pass in the action during and immediately following an interception or potential interception. If\nthe player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless\nplayer. Violations of this provision will be enforced after the interception, and the intercepting team will maintain\npossession.\n(5) A runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped.\n(6) A kickoff or punt returner attempting to field a kick in the air who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player\nis capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(7) A player on the ground.\n(8) A kicker/punter during the kick or during the return (also see Article 8-i for additional restrictions against a kicker/punter).\n(9) A quarterback at any time after a change of possession (also see Article 11-e for additional restrictions against a\nquarterback after a change of possession).\n(10) A player who receives an illegal blindside block.\n(11) A player who receives an illegal crackback block.\n(12) The offensive player who attempts a snap during any scrimmage kick. He is no longer a defenseless player after he has\nhad an opportunity to defend himself or moves downfield.\n(b) Prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is listed below. However, these provisions do not prohibit\nincidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent:\n(1) forcibly hitting the defenseless player’s head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the\ninitial contact is lower than the player’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle\nthe defenseless player by encircling or grasping him;\n(2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defenseless player’s\nbody; or\n(3) illegally launching into a defenseless opponent. It is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves one or both feet prior to contact\nto spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any\npart of his opponent’s body. (This does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be\na defenseless player, as defined in Article 9).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified if the\naction is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.\nARTICLE 10. IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF THE HELMET. It is a foul if a player:\n(a) lowers his head and makes forcible contact with his helmet against an opponent; or\n(b) uses any part of his helmet or facemask to butt or make forcible contact to an opponent’s head or neck area.\nThese provisions do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an\nopponent.\nPenalty: For impermissible use of the helmet: Loss of 15 yards. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first\ndown. The player may be disqualified.\nARTICLE 11. ROUGHING THE PASSER. Because the act of passing often puts a passer in a position where he is particularly\nvulnerable to injury, special rules against roughing the passer apply. Players in a passing posture are considered to be a player\nin a defenseless posture. Any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a\npass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. The following\nprinciples apply:\n(a) Roughing will be called if, in the game official’s judgment, a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already\nleft the passer’s hand before contact was made; pass rushers are responsible for being aware of the position of the ball in\npassing situations; the game official will use the release of the ball from the passer’s hand as his guideline that the passer is\nnow fully protected; once a pass has been released by a passer, a rushing defender may make direct contact with the passer\nonly up through the rusher’s first step after such release (prior to second step hitting the ground); thereafter the rusher must\nbe making an attempt to avoid contact and must not continue to “drive through” or otherwise forcibly contact the passer;\nincidental or inadvertent contact by a player who is easing up or being blocked into the passer will not be considered\nsignificant.\n(b) A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as “stuffing” a passer into the ground\nor unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact\nwith the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture\n(e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on\ntop of him with all or most of the defender’s weight. Instead, the defensive player must strive to fall to the side of the\nquarterback’s body, or to brace his fall with his arms to avoid landing on the quarterback with all or most of his body weight.\n(c) In covering the passer position, game officials will be particularly alert to fouls in which defenders impermissibly use the helmet\nand/or facemask to hit the passer, or use hands, arms, or other parts of the body to hit the passer forcibly in the head or neck\narea (see also the other unnecessary roughness rules covering these subjects). A defensive player must not use his helmet\nagainst a passer who is in a defenseless posture—for example, (1) forcibly hitting the passer’s head or neck area with the\nhelmet or facemask, even if the initial contact of the defender’s helmet or facemask is lower than the passer’s neck, and\nregardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the passer by encircling or grasping him; or (2)\nlowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the passer’s body. This rule\ndoes not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle on a passer.\n(d) A rushing defender is prohibited from forcibly hitting in the knee area or below a passer who has one or both feet on the\nground, even if the initial contact is above the knee. It is not a foul if the defender is blocked (or fouled) into the passer and\nhas no opportunity to avoid him. A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below,\neven if he is being contacted by another player. It is not a foul if the defender swipes or grabs a passer in the knee area or\nbelow in an attempt to tackle him, provided he does not make forcible contact with the helmet, shoulder, chest, or forearm.\n(e) A passer who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has left his hand is obviously out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by an opponent through the end of the down or until the passer becomes a blocker, or a runner, or,\nin the event of a change of possession during the down, until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. However, at any\ntime after the change of possession, it is a foul if:\n(1) an opponent forcibly hits the quarterback’s head or neck area with his helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder\n(2) if an opponent lowers his head and makes forcible contact with any part of his helmet against any part of the passer’s\nbody. This provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional block.\n(f) When the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the\nball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule provided for in (a) above, and the\nprotection against a low hit provided for in (d) above, but he remains covered by all the other special protections afforded to\na passer in the pocket (b, c, and e), as well as the regular unnecessary roughness rules applicable to all player positions. If\nthe passer stops behind the line to clearly establish a passing posture, he will then be covered by all of the special protections\nfor passers.\n(g) The game official must blow the play dead as soon as the passer is clearly in the grasp and control of any tackler behind the\nline, and the passer’s safety is in jeopardy.\nPenalty: For roughing the passer: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down; disqualification, if flagrant.\nARTICLE 12. ROUGHING/RUNNING INTO THE KICKER. No defensive player may run into or rough a kicker who kicks from\nbehind the line unless such contact:\n(a) is incidental to and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight, or occurs simultaneously with the kicker kicking\nthe ball;\n(b) is caused by the kicker’s own motions;\n(c) occurs during a quick kick or when the kicker carries the ball outside the pocket area, unless he clearly establishes a kicking\nposture;\n(d) occurs during or after a run behind the line;\n(e) occurs after the kicker or holder recovers a loose ball on the ground;\n(f) occurs because a defender is pushed or blocked (causing a change of direction) into the kicker; or\n(g) is the result of a foul by an opponent\nItem 1. Roughing the Kicker. It is a foul for roughing the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the plant leg of the kicker while his kicking leg is still in the air;\n(b) slides into or contacts the kicker when both of the kicker’s feet are on the ground. It is not a foul if the contact is not severe,\nor if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender on the ground; or\n(c) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the kicker.\nItem 2. Running into the Kicker. It is a foul for running into the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the kicking leg or foot of the kicker, even if the kicker is airborne when the contact occurs; or\n(b) slides under the kicker, preventing him from returning both feet to the ground.\nPenalties:\n(1) For roughing the kicker: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down. The\nplayer may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\n(2) For running into the kicker: Loss of five yards from the previous spot (not a personal foul). There is not an automatic\nfirst down.\nARTICLE 13. ROUGHING THE HOLDER. It is a foul for roughing the holder if a defensive player:\n(1) forcibly contacts the holder of a place kick, unless the contact:\n(a) is incidental and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight;\n(b) is caused because a defender is blocked into the holder; or\n(c) occurs after the holder recovers a ball that has touched the ground; or\n(2) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the holder.\nPenalty: For roughing the holder: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down.\nThe player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\nNote: When two defensive players are making a bona fide attempt to block a kick from scrimmage (punt, drop kick, and/or\nplace kick), and one of them runs into the kicker or holder after the ball has left the kicker’s foot at the same instant the second\nplayer blocks the kick, the foul for running into the kicker or holder shall not be enforced, unless in the judgment of the Referee,\nthe player running into the kicker or holder was clearly the direct cause of the kick being blocked.\nARTICLE 14. STRIKING, KICKING, TRIPPING OR KNEEING OPPONENTS. All players are prohibited from:\n(a) striking an opponent with his fists;\n(b) kicking or kneeing an opponent;\n(c) tripping an opponent, including the runner;\n(d) striking, swinging at, or clubbing the head or neck of an opponent with the wrist(s), arm(s), elbow(s), or hand(s); or\nExceptions: Contact to the head, neck, or face of an opponent with the palm of the hand is permitted:\n(1) by a defensive player who is attempting to ward off an offensive player at the line of scrimmage, provided that it is not a\nrepeated act against the same opponent during any one contact; or\n(2) by any player in a personal attempt to recover a loose ball.\n(e) striking an opponent below the shoulders with his forearm or elbows by turning the trunk of his body at the waist, or by pivoting,\nor by any other way that is clearly unnecessary.\nPenalty: For prohibited acts in (a-e) above: Loss of 15 yards. If any of the fouls is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant,\nthe offender may be disqualified as long as the entire action is observed by the official(s). If the foul is by the defense, it\nis also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 15. TWISTING, PULLING, OR TURNING THE FACEMASK OR HELMET OPENING. If a player grasps an opponent’s\nfacemask or helmet opening, he must immediately release it. He shall not grasp and control, twist, turn, push, or pull the facemask\nor helmet opening of an opponent in any direction.\nPenalty: For twisting, turning, pushing, pulling, or controlling the mask or helmet opening: Loss of 15 yards. The player\nmay be disqualified if the action is flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 16. HORSE-COLLAR TACKLE. No player shall grab the inside collar of the back or the side of the shoulder pads or\njersey, or grab the jersey at the name plate or above, and pull the runner toward the ground. This does not apply to a runner who\nis in the pocket area or in the area defined by close-line play. If his knees are buckled by the action, it is a foul, even if the runner\nis not pulled completely to the ground.\nPenalty: For a horse-collar tackle: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 17. USE OF HELMET AS A WEAPON. A player may not use a helmet that is no longer worn by anyone as a weapon\nto strike, swing at, or throw at an opponent.\nPenalty: For illegal use of a helmet as a weapon: Loss of 15 yards and automatic disqualification. If the foul is by the\ndefense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 18. HIP-DROP TACKLE. It is a foul if a player uses the following technique to bring a runner to the\nground:\n(a) grabs the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms; and\n(b) unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner’s leg(s) at or\nbelow the knee.\nPenalty: For a hip-drop tackle: Los s of 15 yards and an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 19.

    "context_text": "SECTION 2 PERSONAL FOULS\nARTICLE 1. CLIPPING. Clipping is blocking an opponent from behind below the waist, and is prohibited against a non-runner.\nThis does not apply to offensive blocking in close-line play where it is legal to clip above the knee(s), but it is illegal to clip at or\nbelow the knee(s). See 3-6, close-line play.\nException: An offensive lineman may not clip a defender above the knees who, at the snap, is aligned on the line of\nscrimmage opposite another offensive lineman who is more than one position away, and the defender is responding to the\nflow of the ball away from the blocker. Example: An offensive tackle cannot clip a defensive nose tackle on a sweep away.\nIf there is a block from the side, or if an opponent turns his back as the block is being made, it is not clipping if the opponent\nis able to see or ward off the block.\nIf an offensive player’s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back or side of the leg(s) of a defender, it\nis clipping, including in close-line play.\nWhen a blocker, who is moving in the same direction as an opponent, initially contacts the opponent on his side, and subsequently\ncontacts the opponent below his waist from behind, it is not clipping if the contact is continuous.\nPenalty: For clipping: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 2. PEEL BACK BLOCK. An offensive player cannot initiate contact on the side and below the waist against an opponent\nif:\n(a) the blocker is moving toward his own end line; and\n(b) he approaches the opponent from behind or from the side unless his near shoulder completely crosses the front of both of\nhis opponent’s legs.\nPenalty: For a peel back block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 3. ILLEGAL CUT BLOCK. See 8-4-5.\nARTICLE 4. BLOCKING BELOW THE WAIST. Blocks below the waist are prohibited in the following situations:\n(a) By players of either team after a change of possession; or\n(b) By players of the kicking team after a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt, or Try kick; or\n(c) By players of the receiving team during a down in which there is a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt,\nor Try kick; or\n(d) By players of either team during a scrimmage down prior to a change of possession unless the contact occurs in the tight end\nbox. (Note: Players are prohibited from initiating contact below the waist of an opponent outside the tight end box (See 3-33),\nexcept against a runner or a player who is attempting to catch a forward or backward pass).\nNote: The following blocking restrictions may result in a foul even if they occur in the tight end box:\n(i) Illegal cut block. See 8-4-5.\n(ii) Clipping. See 12-2-1.\n(iii) Peel back block. See 12-2-2.\n(iv) Chop block. See 12-2-5.\n(v) Crackback block. See 12-2-6.\nPenalty: For illegally blocking below the waist: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 5. CHOP BLOCK. All chop blocks are illegal. A chop block is a high/low double team block by the offense in which\none offensive player (designated as A1 for purposes of this rule) blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower while\nanother offensive player (A2) engages that same defensive player above the waist. The order of the blocks is irrelevant. It is not\na foul if the defender initiates the contact with the blocker, or if the blocker is trying to slip or escape from the defender and any\nengagement with him is incidental.\nChop blocks include, but are not limited to, the following situations:\n(a) A1 chops a defensive player while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of\nA2.\n(b) A2 physically engages a defensive player above the waist with a blocking attempt, and A1 chops the defensive player\nafter the contact by A2 has been broken and while A2 is still confronting the defensive player.\n(c) A1 chops a defensive player while A2 confronts the defensive player in a pass-blocking posture but is not physically\nengaged with the defensive player (“lure”).\n(d) A1 blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower, and A2, simultaneously or immediately after the block by\nA1, engages the defensive player high (“reverse chop”).\n(e) A1 is lined up in the backfield at the snap and subsequently chops a defensive player engaged above the waist by A2.\n(f) A1, an offensive lineman, chops a defensive player after the defensive player has been engaged by A2 (high or low).\nPenalty: For chop block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 6. CRACKBACK BLOCK.\nItem 1. Definition. It is an illegal crackback block if the following conditions are fulfilled:\nThe block occurs within an area five yards on either side of the line of scrimmage, including within close-line play, by an offensive\nplayer who is moving toward the position from which the ball was snapped; and\n(a) the offensive player was in a set position and aligned more than two yards outside an offensive tackle (flexed) when the ball\nwas snapped; or\n(b) the offensive player was in a backfield position when the ball was snapped and moved to a position more than two yards\noutside an offensive tackle; or\n(c) the offensive player was in a backfield position and in motion when the ball was snapped.\nItem 2. Prohibited Contact. The following is prohibited against a player who is the recipient of a crackback block:\n(a) Contacting the player below the waist; or\n(b) Initiating contact that is prohibited against a player in a defenseless posture (Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9(b)(1-3)).\nPenalty: For an illegal crackback block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 7. BLINDSIDE BLOCK. It is a foul if a player initiates a block when his path is toward or parallel to his own end line\nand makes forcible contact to his opponent with his helmet, forearm, or shoulder, unless the contact occurs in close-line play prior\nto the ball leaving that area. The ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from shotgun\nposition or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs\nwith the ball himself during a designed play. Any forcible contact in close-line play is still subject to the restrictions for crackback\nand peel back blocks.\nPenalty: For a blindside block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 8. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. There shall be no unnecessary roughness. This shall include, but will not be limited\nto:\n(a) using the foot or any part of the leg to strike an opponent with a whipping motion (leg whip);\n(b) forcibly contacting a runner when he is out of bounds;\nNote: Defensive players must make an effort to avoid contact. Players on defense are responsible for knowing when a runner\nhas crossed the boundary line, except in doubtful cases where he might step on a boundary line and continue parallel with it.\n(c) a player of the receiving team who has gone out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player out of bounds during the kick. If\nthis occurs on a kick from scrimmage, post-possession rules will apply if appropriate (9-5-1);\n(d) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a runner whose forward progress has been stopped, who has slid or\ntaken a knee, or who has declared himself down by going to the ground untouched and has made no attempt to advance.\nSee 7-2-1-d-Notes regarding a sliding player;\n(e) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on any player on the ground either before or after the ball is dead;\n(f) throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;\n(g) unnecessarily running into, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a player who (1) is out of the play or (2) should not\nhave reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead;\n(h) pulling an opponent off a pile of players in an aggressive or forcible manner; or\n(i) a kicker/punter, who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has been kicked, is out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by the receiving team through the end of the down or until he assumes a distinctly defensive position.\nHowever, a kicker/punter is a defenseless player through the conclusion of the down (see 12-2-9-a-8).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the\nofficial(s) to be flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 9. PLAYERS IN A DEFENSELESS POSTURE. It is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player\nwho is in a defenseless posture. A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an\nillegal act. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against an opponent, even if his body position is in motion, and\nirrespective of any acts by him, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.\n(a) Players in a defenseless posture are:\n(1) A player in the act of or just after throwing a pass (passing posture).\n(2) A receiver running a pass route when the defender approaches from the side or behind. If the receiver becomes a blocker\nor assumes a blocking posture, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(3) A player attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player is capable of avoiding\nor warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(4) The intended receiver of a pass in the action during and immediately following an interception or potential interception. If\nthe player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless\nplayer. Violations of this provision will be enforced after the interception, and the intercepting team will maintain\npossession.\n(5) A runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped.\n(6) A kickoff or punt returner attempting to field a kick in the air who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player\nis capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(7) A player on the ground.\n(8) A kicker/punter during the kick or during the return (also see Article 8-i for additional restrictions against a kicker/punter).\n(9) A quarterback at any time after a change of possession (also see Article 11-e for additional restrictions against a\nquarterback after a change of possession).\n(10) A player who receives an illegal blindside block.\n(11) A player who receives an illegal crackback block.\n(12) The offensive player who attempts a snap during any scrimmage kick. He is no longer a defenseless player after he has\nhad an opportunity to defend himself or moves downfield.\n(b) Prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is listed below. However, these provisions do not prohibit\nincidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent:\n(1) forcibly hitting the defenseless player’s head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the\ninitial contact is lower than the player’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle\nthe defenseless player by encircling or grasping him;\n(2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defenseless player’s\nbody; or\n(3) illegally launching into a defenseless opponent. It is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves one or both feet prior to contact\nto spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any\npart of his opponent’s body. (This does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be\na defenseless player, as defined in Article 9).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified if the\naction is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.\nARTICLE 10. IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF THE HELMET. It is a foul if a player:\n(a) lowers his head and makes forcible contact with his helmet against an opponent; or\n(b) uses any part of his helmet or facemask to butt or make forcible contact to an opponent’s head or neck area.\nThese provisions do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an\nopponent.\nPenalty: For impermissible use of the helmet: Loss of 15 yards. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first\ndown. The player may be disqualified.\nARTICLE 11. ROUGHING THE PASSER. Because the act of passing often puts a passer in a position where he is particularly\nvulnerable to injury, special rules against roughing the passer apply. Players in a passing posture are considered to be a player\nin a defenseless posture. Any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a\npass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. The following\nprinciples apply:\n(a) Roughing will be called if, in the game official’s judgment, a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already\nleft the passer’s hand before contact was made; pass rushers are responsible for being aware of the position of the ball in\npassing situations; the game official will use the release of the ball from the passer’s hand as his guideline that the passer is\nnow fully protected; once a pass has been released by a passer, a rushing defender may make direct contact with the passer\nonly up through the rusher’s first step after such release (prior to second step hitting the ground); thereafter the rusher must\nbe making an attempt to avoid contact and must not continue to “drive through” or otherwise forcibly contact the passer;\nincidental or inadvertent contact by a player who is easing up or being blocked into the passer will not be considered\nsignificant.\n(b) A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as “stuffing” a passer into the ground\nor unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact\nwith the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture\n(e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on\ntop of him with all or most of the defender’s weight. Instead, the defensive player must strive to fall to the side of the\nquarterback’s body, or to brace his fall with his arms to avoid landing on the quarterback with all or most of his body weight.\n(c) In covering the passer position, game officials will be particularly alert to fouls in which defenders impermissibly use the helmet\nand/or facemask to hit the passer, or use hands, arms, or other parts of the body to hit the passer forcibly in the head or neck\narea (see also the other unnecessary roughness rules covering these subjects). A defensive player must not use his helmet\nagainst a passer who is in a defenseless posture—for example, (1) forcibly hitting the passer’s head or neck area with the\nhelmet or facemask, even if the initial contact of the defender’s helmet or facemask is lower than the passer’s neck, and\nregardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the passer by encircling or grasping him; or (2)\nlowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the passer’s body. This rule\ndoes not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle on a passer.\n(d) A rushing defender is prohibited from forcibly hitting in the knee area or below a passer who has one or both feet on the\nground, even if the initial contact is above the knee. It is not a foul if the defender is blocked (or fouled) into the passer and\nhas no opportunity to avoid him. A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below,\neven if he is being contacted by another player. It is not a foul if the defender swipes or grabs a passer in the knee area or\nbelow in an attempt to tackle him, provided he does not make forcible contact with the helmet, shoulder, chest, or forearm.\n(e) A passer who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has left his hand is obviously out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by an opponent through the end of the down or until the passer becomes a blocker, or a runner, or,\nin the event of a change of possession during the down, until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. However, at any\ntime after the change of possession, it is a foul if:\n(1) an opponent forcibly hits the quarterback’s head or neck area with his helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder\n(2) if an opponent lowers his head and makes forcible contact with any part of his helmet against any part of the passer’s\nbody. This provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional block.\n(f) When the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the\nball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule provided for in (a) above, and the\nprotection against a low hit provided for in (d) above, but he remains covered by all the other special protections afforded to\na passer in the pocket (b, c, and e), as well as the regular unnecessary roughness rules applicable to all player positions. If\nthe passer stops behind the line to clearly establish a passing posture, he will then be covered by all of the special protections\nfor passers.\n(g) The game official must blow the play dead as soon as the passer is clearly in the grasp and control of any tackler behind the\nline, and the passer’s safety is in jeopardy.\nPenalty: For roughing the passer: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down; disqualification, if flagrant.\nARTICLE 12. ROUGHING/RUNNING INTO THE KICKER. No defensive player may run into or rough a kicker who kicks from\nbehind the line unless such contact:\n(a) is incidental to and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight, or occurs simultaneously with the kicker kicking\nthe ball;\n(b) is caused by the kicker’s own motions;\n(c) occurs during a quick kick or when the kicker carries the ball outside the pocket area, unless he clearly establishes a kicking\nposture;\n(d) occurs during or after a run behind the line;\n(e) occurs after the kicker or holder recovers a loose ball on the ground;\n(f) occurs because a defender is pushed or blocked (causing a change of direction) into the kicker; or\n(g) is the result of a foul by an opponent\nItem 1. Roughing the Kicker. It is a foul for roughing the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the plant leg of the kicker while his kicking leg is still in the air;\n(b) slides into or contacts the kicker when both of the kicker’s feet are on the ground. It is not a foul if the contact is not severe,\nor if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender on the ground; or\n(c) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the kicker.\nItem 2. Running into the Kicker. It is a foul for running into the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the kicking leg or foot of the kicker, even if the kicker is airborne when the contact occurs; or\n(b) slides under the kicker, preventing him from returning both feet to the ground.\nPenalties:\n(1) For roughing the kicker: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down. The\nplayer may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\n(2) For running into the kicker: Loss of five yards from the previous spot (not a personal foul). There is not an automatic\nfirst down.\nARTICLE 13. ROUGHING THE HOLDER. It is a foul for roughing the holder if a defensive player:\n(1) forcibly contacts the holder of a place kick, unless the contact:\n(a) is incidental and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight;\n(b) is caused because a defender is blocked into the holder; or\n(c) occurs after the holder recovers a ball that has touched the ground; or\n(2) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the holder.\nPenalty: For roughing the holder: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down.\nThe player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\nNote: When two defensive players are making a bona fide attempt to block a kick from scrimmage (punt, drop kick, and/or\nplace kick), and one of them runs into the kicker or holder after the ball has left the kicker’s foot at the same instant the second\nplayer blocks the kick, the foul for running into the kicker or holder shall not be enforced, unless in the judgment of the Referee,\nthe player running into the kicker or holder was clearly the direct cause of the kick being blocked.\nARTICLE 14. STRIKING, KICKING, TRIPPING OR KNEEING OPPONENTS. All players are prohibited from:\n(a) striking an opponent with his fists;\n(b) kicking or kneeing an opponent;\n(c) tripping an opponent, including the runner;\n(d) striking, swinging at, or clubbing the head or neck of an opponent with the wrist(s), arm(s), elbow(s), or hand(s); or\nExceptions: Contact to the head, neck, or face of an opponent with the palm of the hand is permitted:\n(1) by a defensive player who is attempting to ward off an offensive player at the line of scrimmage, provided that it is not a\nrepeated act against the same opponent during any one contact; or\n(2) by any player in a personal attempt to recover a loose ball.\n(e) striking an opponent below the shoulders with his forearm or elbows by turning the trunk of his body at the waist, or by pivoting,\nor by any other way that is clearly unnecessary.\nPenalty: For prohibited acts in (a-e) above: Loss of 15 yards. If any of the fouls is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant,\nthe offender may be disqualified as long as the entire action is observed by the official(s). If the foul is by the defense, it\nis also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 15. TWISTING, PULLING, OR TURNING THE FACEMASK OR HELMET OPENING.

    "context_text": "SECTION 1 GENERAL RULES\nARTICLE 1. REFUSAL OF PENALTIES. Unless expressly prohibited, the penalty for any foul may be declined by the offended\nteam and play proceeds as though no foul had been committed. The yardage distance for any penalty may be declined, even\nthough the penalty is accepted. The offended team may not change its decision to accept or decline a penalty after the penalty\nhas been fully administered or the ball has been made ready for play unless Rule 15-7-3-Item 3 applies. In all situations, a\ndisqualified or suspended player must be removed, regardless of the number of fouls or their enforcement, including if the penalty\nis declined.\nARTICLE 2. NUMBER OF DOWN AFTER PENALTY.\nItem 1. Foul by Team A. If the ball is behind the line to gain after the enforcement of a distance penalty for a foul by Team A that\noccurs prior to (between downs) or during a play from scrimmage, the number of the ensuing down remains the same, unless it is\na combination penalty involving loss of down (see Item 2).\nItem 2. Combination Penalty. A combination penalty involving both distance and loss of down is enforced for the following fouls:\n(a) Illegal forward pass from behind or beyond the line (8-1-2)\n(b) Intentional grounding (8-2-1)\n(c) Backward pass that conserves time (8-7-2)\n(d) Illegally handing the ball forward (8-7-4)\n(e) Illegal punt, drop kick, or place kick (9-1-1)\n(f) Illegal batting of the ball (12-5-1)\n(g) Illegal kicking of the ball (12-5-2)\nIf a loss-of-down penalty is enforced prior to fourth down, the number of the ensuing down is one greater than that of the previous\ndown. If it is enforced on fourth down, the ball is awarded to Team B; if there is a combination penalty on fourth down, the distance\npenalty is also enforced.\nItem 3. Line to Gain and Change of Possession. If a change (or multiple changes) of possession is negated by enforcement of\na penalty against Team A during a play from scrimmage, the line to gain for Team A remains the same.\nItem 4. Ball in Advance of Line to Gain. If the ball is in advance of the line to gain after the enforcement of a distance penalty\nfor a foul by Team A during a play from scrimmage, it is first-and-10 for Team A. It is also first-and-10 after enforcement for a dead\nball foul (Section 4, Article 9) by Team A at the end of a play from scrimmage when there has not been a change of possession.\nException: A foul against an official, a team initiating a challenge when it has exhausted its timeouts, and a fifth and\nsubsequent excess timeout for injury, regardless of when they occur, are always treated as a foul between downs.\nItem 5. Foul by Team B. After a penalty for a foul by Team B prior to, during, or after a play from scrimmage, the ensuing down\nis first-and-10 for Team A.\nExceptions:\n(1) Offside\n(2) Encroachment\n(3) Neutral zone infraction\n(4) Delay of game\n(5) Illegal substitution\n(6) Excess time out\n(7) Running into the kicker\n(8) More than 11 players on the field at the snap\n(9) More than 11 players in the formation prior to the snap\n(10) Illegal formation by the defense during a scrimmage kick play\nFor the above exceptions, the number of the down and the line to gain remain the same unless a distance penalty places the ball\non or in advance of the line to gain, in which case it is first-and-10 for Team A.\nItem 6. Foul After Change of Possession. If there is a foul, including a dead ball foul, after team possession has changed during\na down, following enforcement of a distance penalty, it is first-and-10 for the team that was in possession at the time of the foul.\nItem 7. Foul Between Downs. If there is a foul between downs, the down remains the same, unless enforcement of the foul\nresults in a first down.\nItem 8. Double Fouls. If there is a double foul during the down, and the fouls offset, the down is replayed, and the number of the\ndown remains the same.\nARTICLE 3. CHOICE OF PENALTIES (MULTIPLE FOULS). If there is a multiple foul (3-13-1-d) during the down, only one\npenalty may be enforced after the Referee has explained the alternatives to the offended team.\nExceptions:\n(1) A foul against an official, a team initiating a challenge when it has exhausted its timeouts, and a fifth and subsequent\nexcess timeout for injury are not part of a multiple foul and will be enforced in addition to any other foul.\n(2) If there is a personal foul that is also defensive pass interference, both fouls may be enforced."
