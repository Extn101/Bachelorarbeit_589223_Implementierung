    "source_ref": "Rule 3, Section 2, Article 7",
    "context_text": "SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL. A dead ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick.

The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6.

It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds.

If\nthe timeout is by the defense while time is in, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds. If time is in, the game clock will\nstart with the ready for play signal unless the offense chooses to have the clock start on the snap.\nItem 4. Unsportsmanlike Conduct. An attempt to call an excess team timeout, or to call a second timeout in the same dead\nball period, by Team B in an attempt to “freeze” a kicker, shall be ignored and is unsportsmanlike conduct even if inadvertently\ngranted (See 12-3-1-v). The timeout will be charged if inadvertently granted. This will apply to field goal or Try attempts.\nARTICLE 2. INJURY TIMEOUTS. If an official determines a player to be injured, or if attendants from the bench come on the\nfield to assist an injured player, an injury timeout will be called by the Referee. If the AT Spotter identifies a player for medical\nattention, the rules pertaining to Injury Timeouts in Article 3 and Article 4 (c) apply.\nARTICLE 3. INJURY TIMEOUTS PRIOR TO TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. When an injury timeout is called,\nthe injured player must leave the game for the completion of one down. The player will be permitted to remain in the game if:\n(a) either team calls a charged team timeout;\n(b) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(c) the period ends or the two-minute warning occurs before the next snap.\nAt the conclusion of an injury timeout, the game clock will start as if the injury timeout had not occurred. If either team takes or is\ncharged with a timeout, the clock will start on the snap.\nARTICLE 4. INJURY TIMEOUTS AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. After the two-minute warning of a half,\nthe following shall apply:\n(a) If a team has not used its three charged team timeouts, the team of the injured player will be charged a team timeout,\nunless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field\ngoal, or an attempted Try.\n(b) If a team has used its three charged team timeouts, an excess team timeout shall be called by the Referee, unless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field\ngoal, or an attempted Try.\n(c) The player must leave the game for the completion of one down, unless:\n(1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or\n(2) either team calls or is charged a team timeout other than an excess timeout.\nPenalty: For the second and each subsequent excess team timeout after the two-minute warning: Loss of five yards\nfrom the succeeding spot for delay of the game.\nNotes:\n(1) No yardage penalty will be assessed for the first excess team timeout, but a 10-second runoff of the game clock may\nbe applicable pursuant to Note 3 below. At the conclusion of an excess timeout taken while time is in, the game clock\nshall start with the ready for play signal, unless the opponent chooses to have the clock start on the snap. For any\nexcess timeout charged to the defense, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds.\n(2) If the Referee has already called an excess team timeout in that half for a team, any subsequent excess timeout for that\nteam will result in a five-yard penalty, and a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to Note 3\nbelow. (A penalty for a fifth and subsequent excess timeout for injury shall be considered a foul between downs and will\nnot offset a foul or be part of a multiple foul. See 14-1-2-Item 4-Exc.).\n(3) If an excess team timeout is charged against a team in possession of the ball, and the timeout causes the clock to stop\nor delays the clock from starting on the ready for play signal, the ball shall not be put in play until the time on the game\nclock has been reduced by 10 seconds, if the defense so chooses, the play clock reset to 30 seconds, and the game\nclock shall start with the ready for play.\n(4) Either half can end as the result of the 10-second runoff referenced above.\n(5) If an injury timeout is called for both teams during or after a down, charged team timeouts and/or excess team timeouts\nare charged as appropriate, but no yardage or 10-second runoff penalties shall be enforced.\n(6) If a foul by either team occurs during a down in which there is also an injury, such foul does not affect the charging of\nan excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff that may result from the excess timeout, because the foul\nstopped the clock.\n(7) If a dead ball foul by either team occurs after a play in which there is also an injury to the opposing team, such foul\ndoes not affect the charging of an excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff or 40-second play clock reset\nthat may result from the excess timeout.\n(8) The Competition Committee deprecates feigning injuries, with subsequent withdrawal, to obtain a timeout without\npenalty. Coaches are urged to cooperate in discouraging this practice.\n(9) There can never be a 10-second runoff against the defensive team.\nARTICLE 5. REFEREE’S TIMEOUT. Provided that calling timeout is not in conflict with another rule, the Referee may suspend\nplay and stop the clock (Referee’s timeout) at any time without penalty to either team when playing time is being consumed\nbecause of an unintentional delay. Such situations include, but are not limited to:\n(a) when there is the possibility of a measurement for a first down, or if the Referee is consulting with a captain about one;\n(b) when there is an undue pileup on the runner, or while determining possession after a fumble while time is in;\n(c) when there is an undue delay by officials in spotting the ball for the next snap;\n(d) if the snap is made before the officials can assume their positions (See 4-6-5-b if it is a repeated act);\n(e) when there is an injury to an official or member of the chain crew;\n(f) during an officials’ conference; or\n(g) while repairing or replacing game equipment, except player equipment.\nAfter a Referee’s timeout, the time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it was stopped. The play clock and\nthe game clock will start as if the Referee’s timeout had not occurred."

    "context_text": "SECTION 3 CHANGES IN POSITION\nARTICLE 1. REPORTING CHANGE OF POSITION. An offensive player wearing the number of an ineligible pass receiver (50–\n79 and 90–99) is permitted to line up in the position of an eligible pass receiver or T-Formation Quarterback (0–49 and 80–89).\nAn offensive player wearing the number of an eligible pass receiver is permitted to line up in the position of an ineligible pass\nreceiver, provided he lines up within the normal five-player core formed by ineligible players and is not more than two players\nremoved from the middle player of a seven-player line.\nIn both cases, the player must immediately report the change in his eligibility status to the Referee, who will inform the defensive\nteam. He must participate in such eligible or ineligible position as long as he is continuously in the game, but prior to each play\nhe must again report his status to the Referee, who will inform the defensive team. The game clock shall not be stopped, and the\nball shall not be put in play until the Referee takes his normal position.\nARTICLE 2. RETURNING TO ORIGINAL POSITION. A player who has reported a change in his eligibility status to the Referee\nis permitted to return to a position indicated by the eligibility status of his number after:\n(a) a team time out;\n(b) the end of a quarter;\n(c) the two-minute warning;\n(d) a foul;\n(e) a replay review;\n(f) a touchdown;\n(g) a kick from scrimmage;\n(h) a change of possession; or\n(i) the player has been withdrawn for one legal snap.\nPenalty: For a player failing to notify the Referee of a change in his status when required, or an offensive player with an\neligible number reports as ineligible and lines up outside normal five-player core: Loss of five yards for illegal\nsubstitution.\nARTICLE 3. SPEAKERS IN HELMETS. The Coach-to-Player system allows a member of the coaching staff in the bench area\nor the coaches’ booth to communicate to a designated offensive or defensive player with a speaker in his helmet. The\ncommunication begins once a game official has signaled a down to be over and is cut off when the play clock reaches 15 seconds\nor the ball is snapped, whichever occurs first.\nEach offensive and defensive team is permitted no more than one player on the field with a speaker in his helmet. Each team is\npermitted to have a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on offense by its quarterbacks, and a maximum of three\nactive radio receivers to be used on defense by players who have been designated as primary and backup users.\nClubs that have a player whose principal position is as a non-quarterback (e.g., wide receiver, running back) and who also is used\nas a quarterback from time to time must have two helmets for that player—one with and one without radio components.\nWhen a quarterback enters the game for the first time or re-enters the game if he has previously been in the game and removed,\nhe must report to the Referee.\nWhenever the backup defensive user enters or re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire.\nIf the primary defensive user subsequently re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire. If\nthe primary and backup players have been removed from the game, no other player may wear the radio speaker in his helmet.\nTeams must use other methods to communicate signals to their players.\nIt is not necessary that the offensive player with the speaker in his helmet receive the snap.\nFor special teams’ plays, only one player per team with a receiver will be permitted on the field.\nAll players that have radio components in their helmet must have a decal, supplied by the League, displayed on the midline of the\nrear of the helmet. Players who have speakers in their helmets must be identified in the Communication System section of the\nGame Day Administration Report that is submitted to the Referee or a member of his crew no later than one hour and 30 minutes\nprior to kickoff.\nFor additional requirements and policies pertaining to the system, including regulations for the storage of a backup helmet for a\nnon-quarterback who is used as a quarterback, or for the backup defensive player’s helmet, please refer to the Policy Manual for\nMember Clubs/Game Operations.\nPenalty: For a player failing to notify the Referee or Umpire of a change in his status when required: Loss of five yards\nfor illegal substitution."

The game is played by two teams of 11 players each.\nIf Team A has more than 11 players in its formation for more than three seconds, or if Team B has more than 11 players in its\nformation and the snap is imminent, it is a foul. Once the ball is made ready for play, if either team has more than 11 players in its\nformation prior to a free kick, it is also a foul. In these instances, game officials shall blow their whistles immediately and not allow\nthe snap or kick to occur.\nPenalty: For more than 11 players in the formation prior to the snap or free kick: Loss of five yards from the succeeding\nspot.\nIf a team has more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair catch kick is made, the ball\nis in play, and it is a foul.\nException: If Team A is using a designated holder pursuant to 6-1-1-Note, the designated holder may be the 12th person on\nthe field when the ball is kicked for a kickoff or safety kick, but he is a non-player and must leave the field on his team’s sideline\nwith the kicking tee immediately after the ball is kicked (5-2-8-h) and is also subject to the rules of non-player conduct in\naccordance with Rule 13.\nPenalty: For more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone while the ball is in play: Loss of five yards from the\nprevious spot.\nARTICLE 2. PLAYERS NUMBERED BY POSITION. All players must wear numerals on their jerseys in accordance with Rule 5,\nSection 4, Article 3, Item 3.

All other numerals are worn by\nineligible players unless they report a change in their position. See 5-3-1.\nIf a player changes his position during his playing career in the NFL, and such change moves him from a position as an ineligible\npass receiver to that of an eligible pass receiver, or from a position as an eligible pass receiver to that of an ineligible pass receiver,\nhe must be issued an appropriate new jersey numeral. A change in jersey numeral is not required if the change is from an ineligible\nposition to another ineligible position, or from an eligible position to another eligible position, provided that the player has\nparticipated at least one season at his position prior to the change.\nAny request to wear a numeral for a special position not specified above must be made to the Commissioner. During the preseason\nperiod when playing rosters are larger, the League will allow duplication and other temporary deviations from the numbering\nscheme specified above, but the rule must be adhered to for all players during the regular season and postseason. Clubs must\nmake numerals available to adhere to the rule, even if it requires returning to circulation a numeral that has been retired or withheld\nfor other reasons. See 5-3-1 for reporting a change of position."

It\nmust be made from any point on the kicking team’s restraining line and between the inbounds lines.\n(a) A kickoff puts the ball in play at the start of each half, after a Try, and after a successful field goal. A drop kick or place kick\nmay be used for a kickoff.\n(b) A safety kick puts the ball in play after a safety. A drop kick, place kick, or punt may be used for a safety kick. A tee may be\nused for a safety kick.\n(c) An onside kick puts the ball in play by the team who is trailing in the game and declares that form of a free kick to the officials.\nA holder can be used for an onside kick.

Nothing, including a holder or designated holder, can be used to elevate the ball\nmore than one inch above the ground. Once the ball has been placed on the kicking tee, the kicking tee cannot be moved. If\nthe ball falls off the tee, the covering officials must stop play and restart the timing process without penalty to the kicking team.\nIf the ball falls off the tee a second time during the same free kick down, the kicking team then must kick it off the tee with the\nuse of a designated holder during a kickoff or safety kick, or with a holder during an onside kick. The designated holder during\na kickoff or safety kick shall be a uniformed member of the kicking team and may be the 12th person on the field, but he is a\nnon-player, must leave the field on his team’s sideline with the kicking tee immediately after the ball is kicked (5-2-8-h), and\nis also subject to the rules of non-player conduct in accordance with Rule 13.

At least one of the players must be lined up between the inbounds lines.\nb. At least one of the players must be lined up between the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds\nline on each side of the field.\nc.

T-Formation Quarterback. It is legal for a T-Formation Quarterback to go in motion, whether he has placed his hands\nunder center, on his knees, or on the body of the center. However, it is a false start if the action is quick and abrupt. If the player\nfails to come to a complete stop for at least one full second prior to the ball being snapped, it is illegal motion.\nItem 4. Shotgun Formation. A player who is in position to receive the snap in shotgun formation is permitted to shift his feet prior\nto the snap, but any quick and abrupt movement is a false start. This includes thrusting his hands forward when there is not a\nsimultaneous snap.\nItem 5. Attempt to Draw Offside. Any obvious attempt by the quarterback or other player in position to receive the snap to draw\nan opponent offside is a false start.\nItem 6. Shift Converts to False Start. With the game clock running after the two-minute warning of either half, if all offensive\nplayers are not set simultaneously for one full second prior to the snap, it is a false start. If all players get set, and then two or\nmore players shift without resetting prior to the snap, it is a live ball foul for an illegal shift (7-4-7).\nPenalty: For a false start: Loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. The penalty is enforced prior to the snap.\nARTICLE 3. ENCROACHMENT. It is encroachment if a defensive player enters the neutral zone and contacts an offensive player\nor the ball prior to the snap, or if he interferes with the ball during the snap. Officials are to blow their whistles immediately.\nPenalty: For encroachment: Loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. The penalty is enforced prior to the snap.\nARTICLE 4. NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION. It is a neutral zone infraction when the following occur. Officials are to blow their\nwhistles immediately:\n(a) a defender moves beyond the neutral zone prior to the snap and is parallel to or beyond an offensive lineman with an\nunimpeded path to the quarterback or kicker, even though no contact is made by a blocker;\n(b) a defender enters the neutral zone prior to the snap, causing the offensive player(s) in close proximity (including a T-Formation\nQuarterback) to react (move) immediately to protect himself (themselves) against impending contact. If there is no immediate\nreaction by the offensive player(s) in close proximity, and the defensive player returns to a legal position prior to the snap\nwithout contacting an opponent, there is no foul. A flexed or split receiver is considered to be in close proximity if he is lined\nup on the side of the ball on which the violation occurs; other offensive players are considered to be in close proximity if they\nare within two-and-one-half positions of the defender who enters the neutral zone. If the defender is directly over the center,\na T-Formation Quarterback, the center, and the guards and tackles on both sides of the center are considered to be within\nclose proximity; if the defender is in a gap, the two offensive players on either side of the gap are considered to be within\nclose proximity (including a T-Formation Quarterback, if applicable); or\n(c) during the last two minutes of a half the ball is snapped before all members of the defensive team are on their side of the line\nof scrimmage. The offense must be legally set.\nPenalty: For a neutral zone infraction: Loss of five yards from line of scrimmage. Penalty is enforced prior to snap.\nARTICLE 5. OFFSIDE. A player is offside when any part of his body is in or beyond the neutral zone or beyond a restraining line\nfor an onside kick when the ball is put in play.\nPenalty: For offside: Loss of five yards.\nARTICLE 6. COMPLETE STOP. All offensive players are required to come to a complete stop and be in a set position\nsimultaneously for at least one full second prior to the snap. Failure to do so is an illegal shift (see 7-4-2-Item 6 for such an illegal\nshift foul after the two-minute warning of either half which converts to a false start).\nARTICLE 7. SHIFTS. The offensive team must present a legal formation before and after a shift. It is permitted to shift and have\ntwo or more players in motion multiple times before the snap. However, after the last shift, all players must come to a complete\nstop and be in a set position simultaneously for at least one full second.\nIf any eligible backfield player goes in motion (one at a time) after the last shift and comes to a complete stop, there is no\nrequirement for a full second pause before a second player can legally go in motion.\nHowever, if the first player has not come to a complete stop when the second player goes in motion, it is another shift and requires\nanother simultaneous stop for at least one full second by all players.\nIt is also an illegal shift if a T-Formation Quarterback goes in motion and fails to come to a complete stop for at least one full\nsecond before a second player goes in motion.\nPenalty: For an illegal shift: Loss of five yards.\nARTICLE 8. ILLEGAL MOTION. When the ball is snapped, one player who is lined up in the backfield may be in motion, provided\nthat he is moving parallel to or away from the line of scrimmage. No player is permitted to be moving toward the line of scrimmage\nwhen the ball is snapped. All other players must be stationary in their positions.\nIf an eligible receiver who is on the line moves to another position on the line (not forward), he must come to a complete stop prior\nto the snap. If he does not come to a complete stop, it is illegal motion.\nIt is also illegal motion if a T-Formation Quarterback goes in motion and fails to come to a complete stop for at least one full second\nprior to the snap.\nPenalty: For a player illegally in motion at the snap: Loss of five yards."

    "context_text": "SECTION 1 BALL IN PLAY\nARTICLE 1. LIVE BALL. After the ball has been declared ready for play, it becomes a live ball when it is legally snapped or\nlegally kicked (a free kick or fair catch kick). The ball remains dead if it is snapped or kicked before it is made ready for play.\nSECTION 2 DEAD BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL DECLARED. An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended:\n(a) when a runner is contacted by an opponent and touches the ground with any part of his body other than his hands (including\nthe wrist) or feet (including the ankle);\n(b) when a runner is held or otherwise restrained so that his forward progress ends;\n(c) when a quarterback immediately drops to his knee, or simulates dropping to his knee, behind or beyond the line of scrimmage;\nNote: If a quarterback does not immediately drop to a knee, and contact from a rushing defender is unavoidable, it is not a\nfoul unless the defender commits some other act that would constitute unnecessary roughness.\n(d) when a runner declares himself down by:\n(1) falling to the ground or kneeling, and clearly making no immediate effort to advance; or\n(2) sliding or diving. When a runner slides or dives feet or head first or simulates sliding or diving, the ball is dead the instant\nhe touches the ground with anything other than his hands or his feet, or begins to simulate touching the ground;\nNotes:\n(1) Defenders are required to treat a sliding or diving runner as they would a runner who is down by contact.\n(2) A defender must pull up when a runner begins a slide or dive. This does not mean that all contact by a defender is illegal.\nIf a defender has already committed himself, and the contact is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender makes\nforcible contact into the head or neck area of the runner with the helmet, shoulder, or forearm, or commits some other\nact that is unnecessary roughness.\n(3) A runner who desires to take advantage of this protection is responsible for starting his slide or dive before contact by a\ndefensive player is imminent; if he does not and waits until the last moment to begin his slide or dive, he puts himself in\njeopardy of being contacted.\n(e) when a runner is out of bounds;\n(f) when an opponent takes a ball that is in the possession of a runner who is on the ground;\n(g) when a forward pass (legal or illegal) is incomplete (See 8-1-4);\n(h) when any legal or illegal kick touches the receivers’ goal posts or crossbar;\n(i) when a loose ball comes to rest anywhere in the field, and no player attempts to recover it; the official covering the play should\npause momentarily before signaling that the ball is dead. Any legal (or illegal) kick is awarded to the receivers, and any other\nball is awarded to the team last in possession. When awarded to a team behind a goal line, the ball is placed on the one-yard\nline;\n(j) when any legal or illegal kick is caught or recovered by the kickers, except a scrimmage kick that is kicked from behind the\nline and is recovered behind the line (See 9-3-2-Item 3 for exception);\n(k) when a kickoff or safety kick first touches the ground or a player in advance of the front yard line of the landing zone;\n(l) when an onside kick goes untouched beyond the onside kick setup zone;\n(m) when a touchdown, touchback, safety, field goal, or Try has been made;\n(n) when any receiver catches or recovers the ball after a fair catch signal (valid or invalid) has been made, provided the ball has\nnot been touched by an opponent, before or after it strikes the ground;\n(o) when an official sounds the whistle erroneously while the ball is still in play;\n(1) If the ball is in player possession, the team in possession may elect to put the ball in play where it has been declared\ndead or to replay the down.\n(2) If the ball is a loose ball resulting from a fumble, backward pass, or illegal forward pass, the team last in possession may\nelect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost or to replay the down.\n(3) If the ball is a loose ball resulting from a legal forward pass, a free kick, a fair catch kick, or a scrimmage kick, the ball is\nreturned to the previous spot, and the down is replayed.\n(4) If there is a foul by either team during any of the above, and the team in possession at the time of the erroneous whistle\nelects not to replay the down, penalty enforcement is the same as for fouls during a run, forward pass, kick, fumble, and\nbackward pass. If the team in possession elects to replay the down, all penalties will be disregarded, except for personal\nfouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down. If the down is\nreplayed, the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred, and the clock will start on the snap.\n(p) when a fumble is recovered or caught by a teammate of the fumbling player, and the fumble occurs on a play that is subject\nto the “two-minute”, “Try”, or “fourth-down” fumble provisions (See 8-7-5 and 8-7-6);\n(q) when the ball is out of bounds;\n(r) if a loose ball in play strikes a video board, guide wire, sky cam, or any other object, the ball will be dead immediately, and\nthe down will be replayed at the previous spot. In the event the down is replayed, the game clock will be reset to the time\nremaining when the snap occurred, and the clock will start on the snap. All penalties will be disregarded, except for personal\nfouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down; or\n(s) when a runner’s helmet comes completely off.\nARTICLE 2. BALL TOUCHES OFFICIAL. The ball is not dead because it touches an official who is inbounds, or because of a\nsignal by an official other than a whistle. SECTION 3 NEW SERIES OF DOWNS\nARTICLE 1. NEW SERIES FOR TEAM A. A new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to Team A when the following\nconditions exist:\n(a) During a given series, the ball is declared dead in possession of Team A while at or beyond the line to gain;\n(b) Enforcement of a foul by Team B results in the placement of the ball at or beyond the line to gain,\nor if the enforcement of a foul awards an automatic first down to Team A;\n(c) If there is a change of possession during the down, and Team A has possession at the end of the down;\n(d) The kicking team recovers a scrimmage kick anywhere in the field of play after it first has been touched beyond the line of\nscrimmage by the receivers; or\n(e) The kicking team legally recovers a free kick.\nARTICLE 2. NEW SERIES FOR TEAM B. A new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to Team B when the following\nconditions exist:\n(a) Team A fails to advance the ball to the line to gain during a series of downs;\n(b) There is a change of possession during the down, and Team B has possession at the end of the down, or has been awarded\npossession at the end of the down; or\n(c) When the ball is declared dead in possession of the receiving team after a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch kick.\nARTICLE 3. FORWARD PART OF BALL. The forward part of the ball in its position when it is declared dead in the field of play\nshall be the determining point in measuring any distance gained or lost. The ball shall be rotated so that its long axis is parallel to\nthe sidelines before measuring while maintaining the forward most point. When an airborne player of either team completes a\ncatch or interception inbounds after an opponent has driven him backward, the ball is declared dead, and forward progress is\nawarded at the spot where initial contact by the opponent was made after the player established control of the ball while in the air."

Players of either team may advance\nafter catching a backward pass, or recovering a backward pass after it touches the ground. Any snap from center is a backward\npass.\nARTICLE 2. BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS. If a backward pass goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the ball is\ndead (7-6-2-a), and it is next put in play at the inbounds spot. Rule 11 governs if a backward pass is declared dead behind the\ngoal line. During a play that starts after the two-minute warning of either half, if a backward pass goes out of bounds before a\nchange of possession, it is an action that conserves time (4-7-1).\nPenalty: For a backward pass out of bounds before a change of possession during a play that starts after the two-minute\nwarning. Loss of down and 5 yards.\nARTICLE 3. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than a pass or kick, which results in a loss of player possession.\nException: If a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass (3-2-5-Note).\nItem 1. Recovery and Advance. Any player of either team may recover or catch a fumble and advance, either before or after the\nball strikes the ground, unless the fumble occurs on fourth down (See 8-7-5 below), after the two-minute warning, or during a Try\n(See 8-7-6 below).\nItem 2. Legal Recovery. For a legal recovery of a fumble, see 3-2-7.\nItem 3. Out of Bounds in the Field of Play. When a fumble goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a fumble goes backward and out of bounds, the ball is next put in play at the inbounds spot by the team that was last in\npossession;\n(b) If a fumble goes forward and out of bounds, the ball is next put in play at the spot of the fumble by the team that was last in\npossession;\n(c) If a ball is fumbled in a team’s own end zone and goes forward into the field of play and out of bounds, it will result in a safety,\nif that team provided the impetus that put the ball into the end zone (See 11-5-1 for exception for momentum). If the impetus\nwas provided by the opponent, the play will result in a touchback; or\n(d) Notwithstanding any of the above, when there has not been a change of possession during the down, and the spot of the ball\nis not at or beyond the line to gain after fourth down, the ball is awarded to Team B at the spot that the ball is declared dead.\nItem 4. Out of Bounds in End Zone. When a fumble goes out of bounds in the end zone, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a ball is fumbled in the field of play, and goes forward into the opponent’s end zone and over the end line or sideline, a\ntouchback is awarded to the defensive team; or\n(b) If a ball is fumbled in a team’s own end zone or in the field of play and goes out of bounds in the end zone, it is a safety, if\nthat team provided the impetus that sent the ball into the end zone (See 11-5-1 for exception for momentum). If the impetus\nwas provided by the opponent, it is a touchback.\nARTICLE 4. HANDING BALL FORWARD. No player may hand the ball forward except to an eligible receiver who is behind the\nline of scrimmage.\n(a) Loss of player possession by unsuccessful execution of attempted handing is a fumble charged to the player that last had\npossession.\n(b) A muffed handoff (legal or illegal) is a fumble, and the ball remains alive.\nPenalties:\n(a) For handing ball forward beyond the line of scrimmage: Loss of down and five yards from spot of the foul.\n(b) For handing ball forward to an ineligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage: Loss of down and five yards\nfrom the previous spot.\n(c) For handing ball forward after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from the spot of the foul.\nARTICLE 5. FOURTH DOWN FUMBLE. If a fourth down fumble occurs during a play from scrimmage:\n(a) The ball may be advanced by any member of the defensive team.\n(b) The player who fumbled is the only Team A player permitted to recover and advance the ball prior to a change of possession.\n(c) If, prior to a change of a possession, the recovery or catch is by a teammate of the player who fumbled, the ball is dead, and\nthe spot of the next snap is the spot of the fumble, or the spot of the recovery if the spot of the recovery is behind the spot of\nthe fumble.\nARTICLE 6. FUMBLE AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OR DURING A TRY. If a fumble by either team occurs after the twominute\nwarning or during a Try:\n(a) The ball may be advanced by any opponent.\n(b) The player who fumbled is the only player of his team who is permitted to recover and advance the ball.\n(c) If the recovery or catch is by a teammate of the player who fumbled, the ball is dead, and the spot of the next snap is the spot\nof the fumble, or the spot of the recovery if the spot of the recovery is behind the spot of the fumble.\nARTICLE 7. ENFORCEMENT SPOT DURING A BACKWARD PASS OR FUMBLE. If there is a foul by either team during a\nbackward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or fumble. The three-and-one method of enforcement\nis used (see Rule 14, Section 3, Article 6).\n(a) When the spot of the backward pass or fumble is beyond the line of scrimmage, or when there is not a line of scrimmage,\nand there is a foul during the backward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or the spot of the\nfumble. The three-and-one method of enforcement is used. See 14-3-6.\n(b) When the spot of a backward pass or fumble is behind the line of scrimmage, all fouls committed by either team, including a\nfoul by Team B in Team A’s end zone, are enforced from the previous spot, except a foul by the offense in its end zone is a\nsafety if the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot.\n(c) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered\nby the defense, enforcement is from the dead ball spot. If the recovering team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is\nenforced from the spot of its recovery, and it retains possession. This also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike\nconduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the offense, and the offense fails to make\nthe line to gain.\nNotes:\n(1) If Team B gains possession in its end zone, and the impetus was by Team A, if Team B fumbles or throws a\nbackward pass in the end zone, and fouls while the ball is loose, the spot of the fumble or the backward pass is\nconsidered to be the B20-yard line, or the B35-yard line or B20-yard line (as applicable) if the impetus was from a\nfree kick.\n(2) If a Team B player’s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where he fumbles the ball, the spot of the fumble\nis considered to be the spot at which the player established possession. See 11-5-1-Exc. 2. SECTION 1 FORWARD PASS\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITION. It is a forward pass if:\n(a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent’s goal line) after leaving the passer’s hand(s);\n(b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the\npoint at which the ball leaves the passer’s hand(s); or\n(c) a ball is intentionally fumbled and goes forward.\nItem 1. Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional\nforward movement of his hand starts a forward pass.\n(a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he\npasses the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs,\nintentional grounding rules do not apply.\n(b) When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the\ndirection of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply.\n(c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it\nback toward his body, it is a fumble.\n(d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.\nARTICLE 2. LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down.\nIf the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of\nwhether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.\nItem 1. Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including:\n(a) a forward pass thrown when the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released,\nwhether the passer is airborne or touching the ground.\n(b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage.\n(c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it.\n(d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.\nItem 2. Intercepted Illegal Pass. If an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced, and the penalty declined.\nPenalties:\n(a) For a forward pass from beyond the line: Loss of down and five yards from the spot where the ball is released.\n(b) For a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind\nthe line: Loss of down and five yards from the previous spot.\n(c) For a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from where the ball is released.\nNotes:\n(1) Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line,\nregardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do\nnot apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a free kick play, (c) on a fair catch kick play, or (d)\nafter a change of possession.\n(2) Roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-11). If a\npass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer.\nARTICLE 3. COMPLETED OR INTERCEPTED PASS. A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. A forward pass is\ncomplete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is\ninbounds:\n(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and\n(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and\n(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly performs any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward, take an\nadditional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long\nenough to do so.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an\nincomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds.\n(3) A receiver is considered a player in a defenseless posture (See Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9) throughout the entire\nprocess of the catch and until the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent.\n(4) If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers.\nIt is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. If the ball is\nmuffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the\nloose ball.\n(5) If a player, who is in control of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part\nof his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass. It is not necessary\nfor the player to maintain control of the ball when he lands out of bounds.\n(6) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel) then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nARTICLE 4. INCOMPLETE PASS. An incomplete pass is a loss of down, and the ball returns to the previous spot. Any forward\npass (legal or illegal) is incomplete and the ball is dead immediately if:\n(a) The process of the catch in 8-1-3 is not completed;\n(b) The ball goes out of bounds; or\n(c) A player is the first to touch a pass after having been out of bounds, but prior to reestablishing himself inbounds with both feet\nor any body part other than his hands. There is not a foul for illegal touching.\nARTICLE 5. ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. The following players are eligible to catch a forward pass that is thrown from behind the\nline of scrimmage:\n(a) Defensive players;\n(b) Offensive players who are on either end of the line, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (0–49 and 80–\n89) or have legally reported to play a position on the end of the line. See 5-1-2;\n(c) Offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of\neligible players (0–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield;\n(d) All offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player; or\n(e) An eligible receiver who is forced out of bounds by an opponent’s foul, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately\nand reestablishes inbounds with both feet or with any body part other than his hands, without prior touching.\nARTICLE 6. INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. All offensive players other than those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch\na legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including:\n(a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped;\n(b) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible as required by Article 5;\n(c) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, either by his own volition or by being legally forced\nout, even if he has reestablished himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; or\n(d) A player who takes his stance as a T-Formation Quarterback unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position\nat least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line and is stationary in that position for at least one second\nbefore the snap.\nARTICLE 7. LEGAL TOUCHING. A forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible\nplayer. A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass\nin the end zone.\nARTICLE 8. ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A FORWARD PASS. It is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal)\nthrown from behind the line of scrimmage:\n(a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball; or\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass: Loss of five yards at the previous spot.\n(b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being\nlegally forced out of bounds and has reestablished himself inbounds. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball.\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass after being out of bounds: Loss of down at the previous spot.\n"

During a play that starts after the two-minute warning of either half, if a backward pass goes out of bounds before a\nchange of possession, it is an action that conserves time (4-7-1).\nPenalty: For a backward pass out of bounds before a change of possession during a play that starts after the two-minute\nwarning. Loss of down and 5 yards.\nARTICLE 3. FUMBLE.

If the impetus\nwas provided by the opponent, the play will result in a touchback; or\n(d) Notwithstanding any of the above, when there has not been a change of possession during the down, and the spot of the ball\nis not at or beyond the line to gain after fourth down, the ball is awarded to Team B at the spot that the ball is declared dead.\nItem 4. Out of Bounds in End Zone. When a fumble goes out of bounds in the end zone, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a ball is fumbled in the field of play, and goes forward into the opponent’s end zone and over the end line or sideline, a\ntouchback is awarded to the defensive team; or\n(b) If a ball is fumbled in a team’s own end zone or in the field of play and goes out of bounds in the end zone, it is a safety, if\nthat team provided the impetus that sent the ball into the end zone (See 11-5-1 for exception for momentum).

The three-and-one method of enforcement is used. See 14-3-6.\n(b) When the spot of a backward pass or fumble is behind the line of scrimmage, all fouls committed by either team, including a\nfoul by Team B in Team A’s end zone, are enforced from the previous spot, except a foul by the offense in its end zone is a\nsafety if the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot.\n(c) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered\nby the defense, enforcement is from the dead ball spot. If the recovering team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is\nenforced from the spot of its recovery, and it retains possession. This also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike\nconduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the offense, and the offense fails to make\nthe line to gain.\nNotes:\n(1) If Team B gains possession in its end zone, and the impetus was by Team A, if Team B fumbles or throws a\nbackward pass in the end zone, and fouls while the ball is loose, the spot of the fumble or the backward pass is\nconsidered to be the B20-yard line, or the B35-yard line or B20-yard line (as applicable) if the impetus was from a\nfree kick.\n(2) If a Team B player’s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where he fumbles the ball, the spot of the fumble\nis considered to be the spot at which the player established possession.

    "context_text": "SECTION 5 PASS INTERFERENCE\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITION. It is pass interference by either team when any act by a player more than one yard beyond the line of\nscrimmage significantly hinders an eligible player’s opportunity to catch the ball. Pass interference can only occur when a forward\npass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, regardless of whether the pass is legal or illegal, or whether it crosses the line.\nWhen the ball is in the air, eligible offensive and defensive receivers have the same right to the path of the ball and are subject to\nthe same restrictions.\nActs that do not occur more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage are not pass interference but could be offensive or\ndefensive holding (see 12-1-3 and 12-1-6).\nDefensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is thrown until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts\nwhile the ball is in the air.\nOffensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is snapped until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts\nwhile the ball is in the air and Article 4 for prohibited acts prior to the pass.\nARTICLE 2. PROHIBITED ACTS BY BOTH TEAMS WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. Acts that are pass interference include,\nbut are not limited to:\n(a) Contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent’s opportunity to make the catch;\n(b) Playing through the back of an opponent in an attempt to make a play on the ball;\n(c) Grabbing an opponent’s arm(s) in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass;\n(d) Extending an arm across the body of an opponent, thus restricting his ability to catch a pass, and regardless of whether the\nplayer committing such act is playing the ball;\n(e) Cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball;\n(f) Hooking an opponent in an attempt to get to the ball in such a manner that it causes the opponent’s body to turn prior to the\nball arriving; or\n(g) Initiating contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation.\nARTICLE 3. PERMISSIBLE ACTS BY BOTH TEAMS WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. Acts that are permissible by a player\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n(a) Incidental contact by an opponent’s hands, arms, or body when both players are competing for the ball, or neither player is\nlooking for the ball. If there is any question whether contact is incidental, the ruling shall be no interference;\n(b) Inadvertent tangling of feet when both players are playing the ball or neither player is playing the ball;\n(c) Contact that would normally be considered pass interference, but the pass is clearly uncatchable by the involved players,\nexcept as specified in 8-3-2 and 8-5-4 pertaining to blocking downfield by the offense;\n(d) Laying a hand on an opponent that does not restrict him in an attempt to make a play on the ball;\n(e) Contact by a player who has gained position on an opponent in an attempt to catch the ball; or\n(f) When a team presents a punt formation (3-17-7) and before the ball is kicked, acts that normally constitute pass interference\nagainst the end man on the line of scrimmage or against an eligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage, who is aligned or\nin motion more than one yard outside the end man on the line. Defensive holding and offensive pass interference rules still\napply.\nARTICLE 4. OTHER PROHIBITED ACTS BY THE OFFENSE. Acts that are pass interference include:\n(a) Blocking more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage by an offensive player prior to a pass being thrown. See 8-3-1-\nNote for exception for an ineligible offensive player; or\n(b) Blocking a defender beyond the line while the pass is in the air if the block occurs in the vicinity of the player to whom the\npass is thrown. See 8-3-1-Note for exception for ineligible players.\nPenalty: For pass interference by the defense: First down for the offensive team at the spot of the foul. If the interference\nis also a personal foul (12-2), the penalty for such a foul is also enforced, either from the spot of the foul (for interference),\nor from the end of the run if the foul for pass interference is declined. If the spot of the interference is behind the defensive\nteam’s goal line and the previous spot was on or outside the defense’s two-yard line, then, it is first down for the offensive\nteam on the defense’s one-yard line at the inbounds spot corresponding to the spot of the interference, or, if the previous\nspot was inside the defense’s two-yard line, the penalty shall be halfway between the previous spot and the goal line,\nand it is first down for the offensive team.\nPenalty: For pass interference by the offense: Loss of 10 yards from the previous spot."

    "context_text": "SECTION 1 FORWARD PASS\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITION. It is a forward pass if:\n(a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent’s goal line) after leaving the passer’s hand(s);\n(b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the\npoint at which the ball leaves the passer’s hand(s); or\n(c) a ball is intentionally fumbled and goes forward.\nItem 1. Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional\nforward movement of his hand starts a forward pass.\n(a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he\npasses the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs,\nintentional grounding rules do not apply.\n(b) When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the\ndirection of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply.\n(c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it\nback toward his body, it is a fumble.\n(d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.\nARTICLE 2. LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down.\nIf the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of\nwhether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.\nItem 1. Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including:\n(a) a forward pass thrown when the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released,\nwhether the passer is airborne or touching the ground.\n(b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage.\n(c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it.\n(d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.\nItem 2. Intercepted Illegal Pass. If an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced, and the penalty declined.\nPenalties:\n(a) For a forward pass from beyond the line: Loss of down and five yards from the spot where the ball is released.\n(b) For a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind\nthe line: Loss of down and five yards from the previous spot.\n(c) For a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from where the ball is released.\nNotes:\n(1) Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line,\nregardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do\nnot apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a free kick play, (c) on a fair catch kick play, or (d)\nafter a change of possession.\n(2) Roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-11). If a\npass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer.\nARTICLE 3. COMPLETED OR INTERCEPTED PASS. A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. A forward pass is\ncomplete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is\ninbounds:\n(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and\n(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and\n(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly performs any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward, take an\nadditional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long\nenough to do so.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an\nincomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds.\n(3) A receiver is considered a player in a defenseless posture (See Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9) throughout the entire\nprocess of the catch and until the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent.\n(4) If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers.\nIt is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. If the ball is\nmuffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the\nloose ball.\n(5) If a player, who is in control of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part\nof his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass. It is not necessary\nfor the player to maintain control of the ball when he lands out of bounds.\n(6) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel) then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nARTICLE 4. INCOMPLETE PASS. An incomplete pass is a loss of down, and the ball returns to the previous spot. Any forward\npass (legal or illegal) is incomplete and the ball is dead immediately if:\n(a) The process of the catch in 8-1-3 is not completed;\n(b) The ball goes out of bounds; or\n(c) A player is the first to touch a pass after having been out of bounds, but prior to reestablishing himself inbounds with both feet\nor any body part other than his hands. There is not a foul for illegal touching.\nARTICLE 5. ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS.

See 5-1-2;\n(c) Offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of\neligible players (0–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield;\n(d) All offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player; or\n(e) An eligible receiver who is forced out of bounds by an opponent’s foul, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately\nand reestablishes inbounds with both feet or with any body part other than his hands, without prior touching.\nARTICLE 6. INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. All offensive players other than those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch\na legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including:\n(a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped;\n(b) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible as required by Article 5;\n(c) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, either by his own volition or by being legally forced\nout, even if he has reestablished himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; or\n(d) A player who takes his stance as a T-Formation Quarterback unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position\nat least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line and is stationary in that position for at least one second\nbefore the snap.\nARTICLE 7. LEGAL TOUCHING. A forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible\nplayer. A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass\nin the end zone.\nARTICLE 8. ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A FORWARD PASS. It is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal)\nthrown from behind the line of scrimmage:\n(a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball; or\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass: Loss of five yards at the previous spot.\n(b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being\nlegally forced out of bounds and has reestablished himself inbounds. If such a pass is caught, it is a live ball.\nPenalty: For illegal touching of a forward pass after being out of bounds: Loss of down at the previous spot.\n"

It is a foul for intentional grounding if a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure\nfrom the defense, throws a forward pass that is not in the direction and vicinity of an originally eligible offensive receiver. The pass\ndoes not have to be incomplete for intentional grounding to apply.\nItem 1. Passer or Ball Outside Pocket Area. Intentional grounding will not be called when a passer, who is outside, or has been\noutside, the pocket area, throws a forward pass that lands at or beyond the line of scrimmage extended (including when the ball\nlands out of bounds over the sideline or endline), even if no offensive player(s) have a realistic chance to catch the ball. If a loose\nball leaves the pocket area, this area no longer exists; if the ball is recovered, all intentional grounding rules apply as if the passer\nis outside pocket area. A passer is out of the pocket area if any part of his body or the ball is outside the pocket area.\nItem 2. Physical Contact. Intentional grounding should not be called if:\n(a) the passer initiates his passing motion toward an eligible receiver and then is significantly affected by physical contact from a\ndefensive player that causes the pass to land in an area that is not in the direction and vicinity of an eligible receiver; or\n(b) the passer is out of the pocket area, and his passing motion is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive\nplayer that causes the ball to land short of the line of scrimmage.\nItem 3. Stopping Clock. A T-Formation Quarterback is permitted to stop the game clock legally to conserve time if, immediately\nupon receiving the snap, he begins a continuous throwing motion and throws the ball directly into the ground.\nItem 4. Delayed Spike. A passer, after delaying his passing action for strategic purposes, is prohibited from throwing the ball to\nthe ground in front of him, even if he is under no pressure from defensive rusher(s).\nPenalty: For intentional grounding:\n(a) loss of down and 10 yards from the previous spot; or\n(b) loss of down at the spot of the pass if the spot is more than 10 yards from the previous spot or more than half the\ndistance to the goal line; or\n(c) a safety if the passer’s entire body and the ball are in his end zone when the ball is thrown.

If a fair catch is made or awarded outside the inbounds line, the spot of the kick is the nearest\ninbounds line.\n(b) After the ball is kicked, it must not touch the ground or any player of the offensive team before it passes through the goal.\n(c) The entire ball must pass through the vertical plane of the goal, which is the area above the crossbar and between the uprights\nor, if above the uprights, between their outside edges. If the ball passes through the goal, and returns through the goal without\nstriking the ground or some object or person beyond the goal, the attempt is unsuccessful.\nARTICLE 2. MISSED FIELD GOALS. If there is a missed field goal attempt that crosses the line of scrimmage, and the ball has\nnot been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, or in the end zone before the ball has touched\nthe ground in the end zone, the following shall apply:\n(a) If the spot of the kick was inside the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the 20-yard line; or\n(b) If the spot of the kick was from the receivers’ 20-yard line or beyond the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the\nspot of the kick.\nExceptions:\nThe special rules pertaining to field goals in (a) and (b) are not applicable, and all general rules for a scrimmage kick will apply\nwhen there is a missed field goal and:\n(1) the ball is touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone before the ball\nhas become dead; or\n(2) the scrimmage kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the\nline of scrimmage.\nNote: If a foul occurs during an unsuccessful field goal attempt in (1) or (2) above, Rule 14-4-8 governs.\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTES:\n(1) If the receivers do not touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, the ball is dead\nas soon as it touches the ground in the end zone, and it is the receivers’ ball at the spot of the kick, or at the 20-yard line\nif the attempt was from inside the 20-yard line.\n(2) If the ball goes out of bounds after it is first touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, it\nis the receivers’ ball at the out of bounds spot.\n(3) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, and the kickers\nrecover, the ball belongs to the kickers at the spot of recovery. If the recovery is in the end zone, it is a touchdown.\n(4) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, and without any new impetus, the ball\nrolls into the end zone where it is declared dead in the possession of the receivers, it is a touchback.\n(5) For a successful field goal, or for an unsuccessful attempt that does not land in the field of play, the maximum amount of\ntime that can run off the game clock is five seconds.\nARTICLE 3. FAIR CATCH KICK. The rules for a field goal attempt from scrimmage apply to a field goal attempt following a fair\ncatch (a fair catch kick).\nExceptions:\n(1) The fair catch kick line for the kicking team is the yard line through the most forward point from which the ball is kicked.\n(2) The fair catch kick line for the receiving team is the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team’s fair catch kick\nline.\n(3) Though this is not a free kick, the rules for onside free kick formation apply (6-1-6).\nNote: The kicking team cannot possess the ball unless it has first been touched by the receivers.\nARTICLE 4. NO TEE. An artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to assist in the execution of a field goal or Try kick\nattempt.\nARTICLE 5. FOREIGN ARTICLES. No article of any type may be placed on the field, or used in any manner, to assist a player\nin the execution of a field goal or Try kick attempt. Nothing other than a hand or finger may be used to mark the spot or the vicinity\nof a kick or hold.\nARTICLE 6. BALL NEXT IN PLAY. After a field goal, the team scored upon will receive the succeeding free kick (6-1-1-a).\n SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL. A dead ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control."

It is a safety:\n(a) when the offense commits a foul behind its own goal line and the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot (see also\n14-2-2-b); or\n(b) when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line, and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession, or\nthe ball is out of bounds behind the goal line.\nExceptions:\nIt is not a safety:\n(1) If a forward pass from behind the line of scrimmage is incomplete in the end zone.\n(2) If a defensive player, in the field of play, intercepts a pass or catches or recovers a fumble, backward pass, scrimmage\nkick, free kick, or fair catch kick, and his original momentum carries him into his end zone where the ball is declared dead\nin his team’s possession.

BALL IN PLAY AFTER SAFETY. After a safety, the team scored upon must put the ball in play by a free kick (punt,\ndrop kick, or place kick) from its 20-yard line, unless an extension exception applies (4-8-2-g).

After a touchdown, a Try is an opportunity for either team to score one or two additional points\nduring one scrimmage down subject to 4-8-2-c.\nThe Try begins when the Referee sounds the whistle for play to start. The game clock will not run during the Try. The team that\nscored the touchdown shall put the ball in play:\n(a) anywhere on or between the inbound lines;\n(b) 15 yards from the defensive team’s goal line for a Try kick; or\n(c) two yards from the defensive team’s goal line for a Try by pass or run.\nAfter the ball has been declared ready for play, the offensive team may change its choice for any of the above if there is a penalty\nor charged timeout by either team.\nARTICLE 2. RESULTS OF A TRY. During a Try, the following shall apply:\n(a) If a kick results in a field goal by the offense, one point is awarded. An artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to\nassist in the execution of a Try kick.

FOULS COMMITTED DURING TRY.\nIf a foul results in a re-Try, Team A will have the option to enforce the penalty from the spot where it attempted the Try (previous\nspot) or from the yard line for the other Try option, the location of which is determined by any previously enforced penalty, if\napplicable.\nException: Defensive pass interference is a spot foul.

    "context_text": "SECTION 2 PERSONAL FOULS\nARTICLE 1. CLIPPING. Clipping is blocking an opponent from behind below the waist, and is prohibited against a non-runner.\nThis does not apply to offensive blocking in close-line play where it is legal to clip above the knee(s), but it is illegal to clip at or\nbelow the knee(s). See 3-6, close-line play.\nException: An offensive lineman may not clip a defender above the knees who, at the snap, is aligned on the line of\nscrimmage opposite another offensive lineman who is more than one position away, and the defender is responding to the\nflow of the ball away from the blocker. Example: An offensive tackle cannot clip a defensive nose tackle on a sweep away.\nIf there is a block from the side, or if an opponent turns his back as the block is being made, it is not clipping if the opponent\nis able to see or ward off the block.\nIf an offensive player’s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back or side of the leg(s) of a defender, it\nis clipping, including in close-line play.\nWhen a blocker, who is moving in the same direction as an opponent, initially contacts the opponent on his side, and subsequently\ncontacts the opponent below his waist from behind, it is not clipping if the contact is continuous.\nPenalty: For clipping: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 2. PEEL BACK BLOCK. An offensive player cannot initiate contact on the side and below the waist against an opponent\nif:\n(a) the blocker is moving toward his own end line; and\n(b) he approaches the opponent from behind or from the side unless his near shoulder completely crosses the front of both of\nhis opponent’s legs.\nPenalty: For a peel back block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 3. ILLEGAL CUT BLOCK. See 8-4-5.\nARTICLE 4. BLOCKING BELOW THE WAIST. Blocks below the waist are prohibited in the following situations:\n(a) By players of either team after a change of possession; or\n(b) By players of the kicking team after a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt, or Try kick; or\n(c) By players of the receiving team during a down in which there is a free kick, safety kick, fair catch kick, punt, field goal attempt,\nor Try kick; or\n(d) By players of either team during a scrimmage down prior to a change of possession unless the contact occurs in the tight end\nbox. (Note: Players are prohibited from initiating contact below the waist of an opponent outside the tight end box (See 3-33),\nexcept against a runner or a player who is attempting to catch a forward or backward pass).\nNote: The following blocking restrictions may result in a foul even if they occur in the tight end box:\n(i) Illegal cut block. See 8-4-5.\n(ii) Clipping. See 12-2-1.\n(iii) Peel back block. See 12-2-2.\n(iv) Chop block. See 12-2-5.\n(v) Crackback block. See 12-2-6.\nPenalty: For illegally blocking below the waist: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 5. CHOP BLOCK. All chop blocks are illegal. A chop block is a high/low double team block by the offense in which\none offensive player (designated as A1 for purposes of this rule) blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower while\nanother offensive player (A2) engages that same defensive player above the waist. The order of the blocks is irrelevant. It is not\na foul if the defender initiates the contact with the blocker, or if the blocker is trying to slip or escape from the defender and any\nengagement with him is incidental.\nChop blocks include, but are not limited to, the following situations:\n(a) A1 chops a defensive player while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of\nA2.\n(b) A2 physically engages a defensive player above the waist with a blocking attempt, and A1 chops the defensive player\nafter the contact by A2 has been broken and while A2 is still confronting the defensive player.\n(c) A1 chops a defensive player while A2 confronts the defensive player in a pass-blocking posture but is not physically\nengaged with the defensive player (“lure”).\n(d) A1 blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower, and A2, simultaneously or immediately after the block by\nA1, engages the defensive player high (“reverse chop”).\n(e) A1 is lined up in the backfield at the snap and subsequently chops a defensive player engaged above the waist by A2.\n(f) A1, an offensive lineman, chops a defensive player after the defensive player has been engaged by A2 (high or low).\nPenalty: For chop block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 6. CRACKBACK BLOCK.\nItem 1. Definition. It is an illegal crackback block if the following conditions are fulfilled:\nThe block occurs within an area five yards on either side of the line of scrimmage, including within close-line play, by an offensive\nplayer who is moving toward the position from which the ball was snapped; and\n(a) the offensive player was in a set position and aligned more than two yards outside an offensive tackle (flexed) when the ball\nwas snapped; or\n(b) the offensive player was in a backfield position when the ball was snapped and moved to a position more than two yards\noutside an offensive tackle; or\n(c) the offensive player was in a backfield position and in motion when the ball was snapped.\nItem 2. Prohibited Contact. The following is prohibited against a player who is the recipient of a crackback block:\n(a) Contacting the player below the waist; or\n(b) Initiating contact that is prohibited against a player in a defenseless posture (Rule 12, Section 2, Article 9(b)(1-3)).\nPenalty: For an illegal crackback block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 7. BLINDSIDE BLOCK. It is a foul if a player initiates a block when his path is toward or parallel to his own end line\nand makes forcible contact to his opponent with his helmet, forearm, or shoulder, unless the contact occurs in close-line play prior\nto the ball leaving that area. The ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from shotgun\nposition or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs\nwith the ball himself during a designed play. Any forcible contact in close-line play is still subject to the restrictions for crackback\nand peel back blocks.\nPenalty: For a blindside block: Loss of 15 yards.\nARTICLE 8. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. There shall be no unnecessary roughness. This shall include, but will not be limited\nto:\n(a) using the foot or any part of the leg to strike an opponent with a whipping motion (leg whip);\n(b) forcibly contacting a runner when he is out of bounds;\nNote: Defensive players must make an effort to avoid contact. Players on defense are responsible for knowing when a runner\nhas crossed the boundary line, except in doubtful cases where he might step on a boundary line and continue parallel with it.\n(c) a player of the receiving team who has gone out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player out of bounds during the kick. If\nthis occurs on a kick from scrimmage, post-possession rules will apply if appropriate (9-5-1);\n(d) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a runner whose forward progress has been stopped, who has slid or\ntaken a knee, or who has declared himself down by going to the ground untouched and has made no attempt to advance.\nSee 7-2-1-d-Notes regarding a sliding player;\n(e) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on any player on the ground either before or after the ball is dead;\n(f) throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;\n(g) unnecessarily running into, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a player who (1) is out of the play or (2) should not\nhave reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead;\n(h) pulling an opponent off a pile of players in an aggressive or forcible manner; or\n(i) a kicker/punter, who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has been kicked, is out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by the receiving team through the end of the down or until he assumes a distinctly defensive position.\nHowever, a kicker/punter is a defenseless player through the conclusion of the down (see 12-2-9-a-8).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the\nofficial(s) to be flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 9. PLAYERS IN A DEFENSELESS POSTURE. It is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player\nwho is in a defenseless posture. A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an\nillegal act. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against an opponent, even if his body position is in motion, and\nirrespective of any acts by him, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.\n(a) Players in a defenseless posture are:\n(1) A player in the act of or just after throwing a pass (passing posture).\n(2) A receiver running a pass route when the defender approaches from the side or behind. If the receiver becomes a blocker\nor assumes a blocking posture, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(3) A player attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player is capable of avoiding\nor warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(4) The intended receiver of a pass in the action during and immediately following an interception or potential interception. If\nthe player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless\nplayer. Violations of this provision will be enforced after the interception, and the intercepting team will maintain\npossession.\n(5) A runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped.\n(6) A kickoff or punt returner attempting to field a kick in the air who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player\nis capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.\n(7) A player on the ground.\n(8) A kicker/punter during the kick or during the return (also see Article 8-i for additional restrictions against a kicker/punter).\n(9) A quarterback at any time after a change of possession (also see Article 11-e for additional restrictions against a\nquarterback after a change of possession).\n(10) A player who receives an illegal blindside block.\n(11) A player who receives an illegal crackback block.\n(12) The offensive player who attempts a snap during any scrimmage kick. He is no longer a defenseless player after he has\nhad an opportunity to defend himself or moves downfield.\n(b) Prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is listed below. However, these provisions do not prohibit\nincidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent:\n(1) forcibly hitting the defenseless player’s head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the\ninitial contact is lower than the player’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle\nthe defenseless player by encircling or grasping him;\n(2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defenseless player’s\nbody; or\n(3) illegally launching into a defenseless opponent. It is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves one or both feet prior to contact\nto spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any\npart of his opponent’s body. (This does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be\na defenseless player, as defined in Article 9).\nPenalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified if the\naction is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.\nARTICLE 10. IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF THE HELMET. It is a foul if a player:\n(a) lowers his head and makes forcible contact with his helmet against an opponent; or\n(b) uses any part of his helmet or facemask to butt or make forcible contact to an opponent’s head or neck area.\nThese provisions do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an\nopponent.\nPenalty: For impermissible use of the helmet: Loss of 15 yards. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first\ndown. The player may be disqualified.\nARTICLE 11. ROUGHING THE PASSER. Because the act of passing often puts a passer in a position where he is particularly\nvulnerable to injury, special rules against roughing the passer apply. Players in a passing posture are considered to be a player\nin a defenseless posture. Any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a\npass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. The following\nprinciples apply:\n(a) Roughing will be called if, in the game official’s judgment, a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already\nleft the passer’s hand before contact was made; pass rushers are responsible for being aware of the position of the ball in\npassing situations; the game official will use the release of the ball from the passer’s hand as his guideline that the passer is\nnow fully protected; once a pass has been released by a passer, a rushing defender may make direct contact with the passer\nonly up through the rusher’s first step after such release (prior to second step hitting the ground); thereafter the rusher must\nbe making an attempt to avoid contact and must not continue to “drive through” or otherwise forcibly contact the passer;\nincidental or inadvertent contact by a player who is easing up or being blocked into the passer will not be considered\nsignificant.\n(b) A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as “stuffing” a passer into the ground\nor unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact\nwith the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture\n(e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on\ntop of him with all or most of the defender’s weight. Instead, the defensive player must strive to fall to the side of the\nquarterback’s body, or to brace his fall with his arms to avoid landing on the quarterback with all or most of his body weight.\n(c) In covering the passer position, game officials will be particularly alert to fouls in which defenders impermissibly use the helmet\nand/or facemask to hit the passer, or use hands, arms, or other parts of the body to hit the passer forcibly in the head or neck\narea (see also the other unnecessary roughness rules covering these subjects). A defensive player must not use his helmet\nagainst a passer who is in a defenseless posture—for example, (1) forcibly hitting the passer’s head or neck area with the\nhelmet or facemask, even if the initial contact of the defender’s helmet or facemask is lower than the passer’s neck, and\nregardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the passer by encircling or grasping him; or (2)\nlowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the passer’s body. This rule\ndoes not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle on a passer.\n(d) A rushing defender is prohibited from forcibly hitting in the knee area or below a passer who has one or both feet on the\nground, even if the initial contact is above the knee. It is not a foul if the defender is blocked (or fouled) into the passer and\nhas no opportunity to avoid him. A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below,\neven if he is being contacted by another player. It is not a foul if the defender swipes or grabs a passer in the knee area or\nbelow in an attempt to tackle him, provided he does not make forcible contact with the helmet, shoulder, chest, or forearm.\n(e) A passer who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has left his hand is obviously out of the play and must not be\nunnecessarily contacted by an opponent through the end of the down or until the passer becomes a blocker, or a runner, or,\nin the event of a change of possession during the down, until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. However, at any\ntime after the change of possession, it is a foul if:\n(1) an opponent forcibly hits the quarterback’s head or neck area with his helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder\n(2) if an opponent lowers his head and makes forcible contact with any part of his helmet against any part of the passer’s\nbody. This provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional block.\n(f) When the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the\nball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule provided for in (a) above, and the\nprotection against a low hit provided for in (d) above, but he remains covered by all the other special protections afforded to\na passer in the pocket (b, c, and e), as well as the regular unnecessary roughness rules applicable to all player positions. If\nthe passer stops behind the line to clearly establish a passing posture, he will then be covered by all of the special protections\nfor passers.\n(g) The game official must blow the play dead as soon as the passer is clearly in the grasp and control of any tackler behind the\nline, and the passer’s safety is in jeopardy.\nPenalty: For roughing the passer: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down; disqualification, if flagrant.\nARTICLE 12. ROUGHING/RUNNING INTO THE KICKER. No defensive player may run into or rough a kicker who kicks from\nbehind the line unless such contact:\n(a) is incidental to and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight, or occurs simultaneously with the kicker kicking\nthe ball;\n(b) is caused by the kicker’s own motions;\n(c) occurs during a quick kick or when the kicker carries the ball outside the pocket area, unless he clearly establishes a kicking\nposture;\n(d) occurs during or after a run behind the line;\n(e) occurs after the kicker or holder recovers a loose ball on the ground;\n(f) occurs because a defender is pushed or blocked (causing a change of direction) into the kicker; or\n(g) is the result of a foul by an opponent\nItem 1. Roughing the Kicker. It is a foul for roughing the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the plant leg of the kicker while his kicking leg is still in the air;\n(b) slides into or contacts the kicker when both of the kicker’s feet are on the ground. It is not a foul if the contact is not severe,\nor if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender on the ground; or\n(c) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the kicker.\nItem 2. Running into the Kicker. It is a foul for running into the kicker if a defensive player:\n(a) contacts the kicking leg or foot of the kicker, even if the kicker is airborne when the contact occurs; or\n(b) slides under the kicker, preventing him from returning both feet to the ground.\nPenalties:\n(1) For roughing the kicker: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down. The\nplayer may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\n(2) For running into the kicker: Loss of five yards from the previous spot (not a personal foul). There is not an automatic\nfirst down.\nARTICLE 13. ROUGHING THE HOLDER. It is a foul for roughing the holder if a defensive player:\n(1) forcibly contacts the holder of a place kick, unless the contact:\n(a) is incidental and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight;\n(b) is caused because a defender is blocked into the holder; or\n(c) occurs after the holder recovers a ball that has touched the ground; or\n(2) commits any other act of unnecessary roughness against the holder.\nPenalty: For roughing the holder: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down.\nThe player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant.\nNote: When two defensive players are making a bona fide attempt to block a kick from scrimmage (punt, drop kick, and/or\nplace kick), and one of them runs into the kicker or holder after the ball has left the kicker’s foot at the same instant the second\nplayer blocks the kick, the foul for running into the kicker or holder shall not be enforced, unless in the judgment of the Referee,\nthe player running into the kicker or holder was clearly the direct cause of the kick being blocked.\nARTICLE 14. STRIKING, KICKING, TRIPPING OR KNEEING OPPONENTS. All players are prohibited from:\n(a) striking an opponent with his fists;\n(b) kicking or kneeing an opponent;\n(c) tripping an opponent, including the runner;\n(d) striking, swinging at, or clubbing the head or neck of an opponent with the wrist(s), arm(s), elbow(s), or hand(s); or\nExceptions: Contact to the head, neck, or face of an opponent with the palm of the hand is permitted:\n(1) by a defensive player who is attempting to ward off an offensive player at the line of scrimmage, provided that it is not a\nrepeated act against the same opponent during any one contact; or\n(2) by any player in a personal attempt to recover a loose ball.\n(e) striking an opponent below the shoulders with his forearm or elbows by turning the trunk of his body at the waist, or by pivoting,\nor by any other way that is clearly unnecessary.\nPenalty: For prohibited acts in (a-e) above: Loss of 15 yards. If any of the fouls is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant,\nthe offender may be disqualified as long as the entire action is observed by the official(s). If the foul is by the defense, it\nis also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 15. TWISTING, PULLING, OR TURNING THE FACEMASK OR HELMET OPENING. If a player grasps an opponent’s\nfacemask or helmet opening, he must immediately release it. He shall not grasp and control, twist, turn, push, or pull the facemask\nor helmet opening of an opponent in any direction.\nPenalty: For twisting, turning, pushing, pulling, or controlling the mask or helmet opening: Loss of 15 yards. The player\nmay be disqualified if the action is flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 16. HORSE-COLLAR TACKLE. No player shall grab the inside collar of the back or the side of the shoulder pads or\njersey, or grab the jersey at the name plate or above, and pull the runner toward the ground. This does not apply to a runner who\nis in the pocket area or in the area defined by close-line play. If his knees are buckled by the action, it is a foul, even if the runner\nis not pulled completely to the ground.\nPenalty: For a horse-collar tackle: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 17. USE OF HELMET AS A WEAPON. A player may not use a helmet that is no longer worn by anyone as a weapon\nto strike, swing at, or throw at an opponent.\nPenalty: For illegal use of a helmet as a weapon: Loss of 15 yards and automatic disqualification. If the foul is by the\ndefense, it is also an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 18. HIP-DROP TACKLE. It is a foul if a player uses the following technique to bring a runner to the\nground:\n(a) grabs the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms; and\n(b) unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner’s leg(s) at or\nbelow the knee.\nPenalty: For a hip-drop tackle: Los s of 15 yards and an automatic first down.\nARTICLE 19. OTHER PERSONAL FOULS. Fouls that include a 15-yard penalty but are not listed in this Section or in Section 3,\nare considered Personal Fouls for penalty enforcement purposes."

Penalties for fouls committed by non-players shall be enforced as provided for in Rule 13.\nARTICLE 3. ENFORCEMENT SPOT NOT GOVERNED. When the spot of enforcement is not governed by a general or specific\nrule, it is the spot of the foul.\nARTICLE 4. SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT.

For fouls committed during a run, a backward pass, or a fumble,\nthe penalty is enforced from the basic spot if:\n(a) the defense fouls in advance of the basic spot;\n(b) the defense fouls behind the basic spot; or\n(c) the offense fouls in advance of the basic spot.\nIf the offense fouls behind the basic spot, enforcement is from the spot of the foul (three-and-one method of enforcement).\nExceptions for fouls committed by the offense:\n(1) Fouls committed by the offense behind the line of scrimmage are enforced from the previous spot.\n(2) If the offense commits a foul behind its own goal line, it is a safety if the defense elects to enforce the penalty at that spot.\nSee Rule 8-2-1 for enforcement for intentional grounding. (3) If the offense commits a foul beyond the line of scrimmage and the basic spot is behind the line of scrimmage,\nenforcement is from the previous spot. If the dead ball spot is in the offensive end zone, it is a safety, regardless of where\nthe foul occurs.\n(4) If the offense commits a foul in the defense’s end zone prior to scoring a touchdown, enforcement is from the goal line.\nException for fouls committed by the defense:\n(1) When the basic spot is behind the line of scrimmage, and the defense has committed a foul either behind or beyond the\nline of scrimmage, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot."

Line to Gain and Change of Possession. If a change (or multiple changes) of possession is negated by enforcement of\na penalty against Team A during a play from scrimmage, the line to gain for Team A remains the same.\nItem 4. Ball in Advance of Line to Gain.

If there is a foul, including a dead ball foul, after team possession has changed during\na down, following enforcement of a distance penalty, it is first-and-10 for the team that was in possession at the time of the foul.\nItem 7. Foul Between Downs. If there is a foul between downs, the down remains the same, unless enforcement of the foul\nresults in a first down.\nItem 8. Double Fouls. If there is a double foul during the down, and the fouls offset, the down is replayed, and the number of the\ndown remains the same.\nARTICLE 3. CHOICE OF PENALTIES (MULTIPLE FOULS). If there is a multiple foul (3-13-1-d) during the down, only one\npenalty may be enforced after the Referee has explained the alternatives to the offended team.\nExceptions:\n(1) A foul against an official, a team initiating a challenge when it has exhausted its timeouts, and a fifth and subsequent\nexcess timeout for injury are not part of a multiple foul and will be enforced in addition to any other foul.\n(2) If there is a personal foul that is also defensive pass interference, both fouls may be enforced.\n"

If the score is tied at the end of the period, the game shall result in a tie.\n(e) Each team shall be entitled to two timeouts, and if there is an excess timeout, the usual rules shall apply (see 4-5). The\ngeneral provisions for the fourth quarter of a game, including timing, shall apply.\nARTICLE 4. OVERTIME IN POSTSEASON. Following an intermission of no more than three minutes after the end of the\nregular game, an extra period of 15 minutes shall commence. The following shall apply:\n(a) Both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball at least once during the extra period, unless the team kicking off\nto start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off\nis the winner.\n(b) After each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball, if one team has more points than its opponent, it is the winner,\nsubject to Article 5(a) below.\n(c) If the team that possesses the ball first does not score on its initial possession, or if the score is tied after each team has\nhad its opportunity to possess the ball, the team next scoring by any method shall be the winner.\n(d) If the score is tied at the end of a 15-minute overtime period, or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended,\nanother overtime period will begin, and play will continue, regardless of how many 15-minute periods are necessary.\n(e) Between each overtime period, there shall be a two-minute intermission, but there shall be no halftime intermission after the\nsecond period. At the beginning of the third overtime period, the captain who lost the coin toss prior to the first overtime\nperiod shall have the first choice of the two privileges in 4-2-2, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred.\n(f) At the end of the first and third extra periods, etc., teams must change goals in accordance with 4-2-3.\n(g) Each team is entitled to three timeouts during a half. If there is an excess timeout, the usual rules shall apply (see 4-5).\n(h) At the end of a second overtime period, timing rules shall apply as at the end of the first half. At the end of a fourth overtime\nperiod, timing rules shall apply as at the end of the fourth period.\n(i) At the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss pursuant to Section 1, Article 2, and play will continue\nuntil a winner is declared.\nARTICLE 5. GENERAL RULES APPLICABLE TO OVERTIME. The following applies in both the regular season and\npostseason.\n(a) If the first team to possess the ball scores a field goal or touchdown, after which the second team loses possession by an\ninterception or fumble, the down will be permitted to run to its conclusion, and all rules of the game will be enforced as\ncustomary, including awarding points scored by either team during the down. Only fouls that require the down to be\nreplayed, fouls that negate a score, or palpably unfair acts will be enforced.\nNotes:\n(1) In such situations, if the player who intercepts the pass or recovers the fumble goes to the ground and makes no effort\nto advance, the covering official will blow his whistle to end the game.\n(2) If the second team loses possession by an interception or fumble, but the opponent committed a foul prior to the\nchange of possession, the second team’s possession has not legally ended, and the game cannot end on the down.\nHowever, in certain situations, the second team cannot decline the penalty and accept the result of the play, or accept\na penalty enforcement, if it would create a second possession for itself. In that situation, it can only accept an\nenforcement that extends its initial possession.\n(3) The situation in (2) may also affect the team that receives the opening kickoff during its first possession. If there is a\nfoul by the second team followed by a double change of possession, and the first team accepts the result of the play,\nthe second team has had its required possession, and the first team has possession of the ball for the second time.\nHowever, if it accepts the penalty, it will extend its initial possession.\n(b) A player is in possession when he has a firm grip and control of the ball inbounds (3-2-7). The defense gains possession\nwhen it catches, intercepts, or recovers a loose ball.\n(c) The opportunity to possess applies only during kicking plays. A kickoff is the opportunity to possess for the receiving team.\nIf the kicking team legally recovers the kick, the receiving team is considered to have had its opportunity. A punt or field goal\nattempt that crosses the line of scrimmage and is muffed by the receiving team is considered to be an opportunity to\npossess for the receiving team. Normal touching rules by the kicking team apply.\n(d) All replay reviews will be initiated by the Replay Official. Coaches’ challenges will not be allowed.\n(e) Disqualified player(s) shall not re-enter during any extra period or periods.\n(f) Except as provided for above, all other general and specific rules shall apply."

    "context_text": "SECTION 1 EMERGENCIES\nARTICLE 1. NON-PLAYER ON FIELD. If any non-player, including photographers, reporters, employees, police or spectators,\nenters the field of play or end zones, and in the judgment of an official said party or parties interfere with the play, the Referee,\nafter consulting the crew (13-1-7 and 19-1-3), shall enforce any such penalty or score as the interference warrants.\nARTICLE 2. FIELD CONTROL. If spectators enter the field and/or interfere with the progress of the game in such a manner\nthat in the opinion of the Referee the game cannot continue, the Referee shall declare timeout. In such a case, the Referee shall\nrecord the number of the down, distance to be gained, and the position of the ball on the field. The Referee shall also secure\nfrom the Line Judge the playing time remaining and record it. The Referee shall then order the home club through its\nmanagement to have the field cleared, and when it is cleared and order restored and the safety of the spectators, players and\nofficials is assured to the satisfaction of the Referee, the game must continue even if it is necessary to use lights.\nARTICLE 3. GAME CALLED. If the game must be called due to a state or municipal law, or by darkness if no lights are\navailable, an immediate report shall be made to the Commissioner by the home club, visiting club, and officials. On receipt of all\nreports, the Commissioner shall make a decision which will be final.\nARTICLE 4. EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. The NFL affirms the position that in most circumstances all regular season and\npostseason games should be played to their conclusion. If, in the opinion of appropriate League authorities, it is impossible to\nbegin or continue a game due to an emergency, or a game is deemed to be imminently threatened by any such emergency\n(e.g., severely inclement weather, lightning, flooding, power failure), the following procedures (Articles 5 through 11) will serve\nas guidelines for the Commissioner and/or the duly appointed representatives. The Commissioner has the authority to review\nthe circumstances of each emergency and to adjust the following procedures in whatever manner the Commissioner deems\nappropriate. If, in the Commissioner’s opinion, it is reasonable to project that the resumption of an interrupted game would not\nchange its ultimate result or adversely affect any other inter-team competitive issue, the Commissioner is empowered to\nterminate the game.\nARTICLE 5. LEAGUE AUTHORITY. The League employees vested with the authority to define emergencies under these\nprocedures are the Commissioner, designated representatives from the League office staff, and the game Referee. In those\ninstances where neither the Commissioner nor the designated representative is in attendance at a game, the Referee will have\nsole authority; provided, however, that if the Referee delays the beginning of or interrupts a game for a significant period of time\ndue to an emergency, the Referee must make every effort to contact the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designated\nrepresentative for consultation. In all cases of significant delay, the League authorities will consult with the management of the\nparticipating clubs and will attempt to obtain appropriate information from outside sources, if applicable (e.g., weather bureau,\npolice).\nARTICLE 6. LATER DATE. If, because of an emergency, a regular season or postseason game is not started at its scheduled\ntime and cannot be played at any later time that same day, the game nevertheless must be played on a subsequent date to be\ndetermined by the Commissioner.\nARTICLE 7. PRE-GAME THREAT. If there is deemed to be a threat of an emergency that may occur during the playing of a\ngame (e.g., an incoming tropical storm), the starting time of such game will not be moved to an earlier time unless there is\nclearly sufficient time to make an orderly change.\nARTICLE 8. INTERRUPTED GAME. If, under emergency circumstances, an interrupted regular season or post season game\ncannot be completed on the same day, such game will be rescheduled by the Commissioner and resumed at that point.\nARTICLE 9. ALTERNATE DATES, SITES. In instances under these emergency procedures which require the Commissioner to\nreschedule a regular season game, the Commissioner will make every effort to set the game for no later than two days after its\noriginally scheduled date, and will attempt to schedule the game at its original site. If unable to do so, the Commissioner will\nschedule it at the nearest available facility. If it is impossible to schedule the game within two days after its original date, the\nCommissioner will be guided by the Emergencies and Unfair Acts provisions in the Policy Manual for Member Clubs: Game\nOperations.\nARTICLE 10. POSTSEASON INTERRUPTION. If an emergency interrupts a postseason game and such game cannot be\nresumed on that same date, the Commissioner will make every effort to arrange for its completion as soon as possible. If unable\nto schedule the game at the same site, the Commissioner will select an appropriate alternate site. The Commissioner will\nterminate the game short of completion only, if in the Commissioner’s judgment, the continuation of the game would not be\nnormally expected to alter the ultimate result.\nARTICLE 11. GAME RESUMPTION. In all instances where a game is resumed after interruption, either on the same date or a\nsubsequent date, the resumption will begin at the point at which the game was interrupted. At the time of interruption, the\nReferee will call timeout and will make a record of the following: the team possessing the ball, direction in which its offense was\nheaded, position of the ball on the field, down, distance, period, time remaining in the period, and any other pertinent information\nrequired for an efficient and equitable resumption of play."
