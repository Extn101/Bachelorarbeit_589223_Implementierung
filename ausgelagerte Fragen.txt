    "question": "Ein Spieler springt hoch, fängt den Ball fest mit den Händen, wird aber von einem Gegner ins Aus geschoben, bevor seine Füße den Boden berühren. Hat er den Ball gefangen (Catch)?",
    "ground_truth": "Nein. Er muss selbstständig im Feld landen (beide Füße inbounds). Dass er gedrängt wurde, spielt keine Rolle mehr (keine Force-Out Regel).",

    "context_text": "SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL\nARTICLE 1. DEAD BALL. A dead ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is between downs.\nThis includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put\nin play.\nARTICLE 2. BALL READY FOR PLAY. A dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is\nplaced down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second play\nclock to start.\nARTICLE 3. LIVE BALL. A live ball is a ball that is in play. A dead ball becomes a live ball when it is:\n(a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3; 6-1-6);\n(b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-6-1); or\n(c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down (10-2-4;11-4-3).\nIt continues in play until the down ends (3-8-1).\nARTICLE 4. LOOSE BALL. A loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed,\nor fumbled. A loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a\nloose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in\nflight.\nARTICLE 5. FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a\nloss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. A fumble ends when a player of\neither team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. The use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession\nof a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a–c).\nARTICLE 6. MUFF. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.\nNote: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-14).\nTouching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or\nwith any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).\n(a) See 6-1-4, 6-1-6 and 6-2-5 for touching a free kick.\n(b) See 6-2-4 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines or in advance of the front yard line of\nthe landing zone.\n(c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line.\n(d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent.\n(e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal.\n(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a\nfirst touch by the kicking team.\nARTICLE 7. PLAYER POSSESSION.\nA player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.\nTo gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the\nball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground\ninbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly perform any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward,\ntake an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit\nsuch an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline,\nand in the end zone.\nNotes:\n(1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control.\n(2) If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses\ncontrol of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out\nof bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player\npossession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).\n(3) If any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal continuous motion of taking a step (heel-toe or toe-heel), then\nthe foot is out of bounds. A player is inbounds if he drags his foot, or if there is a delay between the heel-toe or toe-heel\ntouching the ground.\nThe terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).\nA catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made\nwhen an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.\nNotes:\n(1) It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball\nprior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.\n(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by\ncontact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who\ncaught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.\nA recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.\nIf a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball\nbelongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch\nkick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.\n"
