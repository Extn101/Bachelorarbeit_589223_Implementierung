RULE 2 THE BALL
SECTION 1 DIMENSIONS
The ball must be a “Wilson,” hand selected, bearing the signature of the Commissioner of the League, Roger Goodell.
The ball shall be made up of an inflated (12½ to 13½ pounds) urethane bladder enclosed in a pebble grained, leather case (natural
tan color) without corrugations of any kind. It shall have the form of a prolate spheroid, and the size and weight shall be: long axis,
11 to 11¼ inches; long circumference, 28 to 28½ inches; short circumference, 21 to 21¼ inches; weight, 14 to 15 ounces.
The Referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A League-approved
inflation measurement device will be provided to the officials for every game. In addition, a pump is to be furnished by the home
club. The balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to members of the ball crew just prior to
the start of the game.
SECTION 2 SUPPLY
Each team will make 12 primary, 12 backup, and three specially marked kicking balls available for testing by the Referee no later
than two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game to meet League requirements.
In the event a team ball does not conform to specifications, or its supply is exhausted, the Referee shall secure a proper ball from
the opposing team and, failing that, use the best available ball. Any such circumstances must be reported to the Commissioner.
In case of rain or a wet, muddy, or slippery field, a playable ball shall be used at the request of the offensive team’s center.
The game clock shall not stop for such action (unless undue delay occurs).
